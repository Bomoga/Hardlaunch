Scale Testing
in Your Organization

You are very familiar with the process of Testing
Business Ideas. You have read all of the books that
cover the topic. You have run several projects and
built minimum viable products. Now you want to up
your game and boost your testing skills.

You are tasked with systematizing and scaling testing
activities in your organization. You are experienced
with the topic and are looking for state-of-the-art
practical thinking to bring to teams throughout your
organization.

Which best describes you?

VI

This book was made for
Corporate Innovators,
Startup Entrepreneurs,
and Solopreneurs.

Corporate Innovator who is challenging the
status quo and who is building new business
ventures within the constraints of a large
organization.

Startup Entrepreneur who wants to test the
building blocks of your business model to
avoid wasting the time, energy, and money
of the team, cofounders, and investors.

Solopreneur who has a side hustle or
an idea that isn’t quite yet a business.

Which of the following resonates with you?

□□ I am seeking to find new
ways to experiment, instead
of always relying on focus
groups, interviews, and
surveys.

□□ I want to succeed at creating new growth but don’t
want to accidentally damage my company’s brand in
the testing process.

□□ I understand that to be
truly disruptive, I need a
dedicated team who owns
the work and is capable of
creating their own evidence.
VII

□□ I know the perils of prematurely scaling a company
that isn’t quite ready yet, so
I want to test my business
model to produce evidence
that shows I am on the right
track.

□□ I know that I need to
allocate limited resources
wisely and make decisions
based on strong evidence.

□□ I want to fall asleep at
night knowing we've spent
our frantic day working on
the most important things
that matter to our startup’s
success.

□□ I am mindful that we need
to show evidence of progress to justify current and
future investment rounds.

□□ I don’t have the resources of
a funded startup, let alone
a corporation.

□□ I haven’t necessarily tried
any of this before, so I want
to make these late nights
and weekends worth it.

□□ I eventually want to devote
all of my time to this idea,
but it all seems so risky. In
order to make the leap, I'll
need the evidence that I'm
onto something big.

□□ I have read a few books on
entrepreneurship, but need
guidance on how to test my
ideas and what types of
experiments to run.

How to Get from a Good Idea
to a Validated Business
Too many entrepreneurs and innovators execute ideas prematurely because they look
great in presentations, make excellent sense
in the spreadsheet, and look irresistible in
the business plan… only to learn later that
their vision turned out to be a hallucination.

VIII

Systematically applying Customer Development
and Lean Startup
This book builds on the seminal work by Steve Blank
whose Customer Development methodology and the
concept of “getting out of the building” to test business ideas launched the Lean Startup movement and
Eric Ries who coined the term Lean Startup.

Don’t make the mistake
of executing business ideas

STEVE BLANK

Testing is the activity of reducing the risk of pursuing
ideas that look good in theory, but won’t work in reality. You test ideas by conducting rapid experiments
that allow you to learn and adapt.
This book outlines the most extensive testing
library on the market to help you make your ideas
bulletproof with evidence. Test extensively to avoid
wasting time, energy, and resources on ideas that
won’t work.

Inventor of Customer Development and
Godfather of the Lean Startup Movement

Business Concept Design
Design is the activity of turning vague ideas,
market insights, and evidence into concrete
value propositions and solid business
models. Good design involves the use of
strong business model patterns to maximize
returns and compete beyond product, price,
and technology.
The risk is that a business can’t get
access to key resources (technology, IP,
brand, etc.), can’t develop capabilities to
perform key activities, or can’t find key
partners to build and scale the value
proposition.

Testing and reducing risk
To test a big business idea you break
it down into smaller chunks of testable
hypotheses. These hypotheses cover three
types of risk. First, that customers aren’t
interested in your idea (desirability). S
­ econd,
that you can’t build and deliver your idea
(feasibility). Third, that you can’t earn
enough money from your idea (viability).
You test your most important hypotheses with appropriate experiments. Each
experiment generates evidence and insights
that allow you to learn and decide. Based
on the evidence and your insights you either
adapt your idea, if you learn you were
on the wrong path, or continue testing other
aspects of your idea, if the evidence
supports your direction.

Desirability risk
Customers aren’t interested
The risk is that the market a
business is targeting is too

want the value proposition; or
that the company can’t reach,
acquire, and retain targeted
customers.

XI

Viability risk
We can’t earn enough money
Feasibility risk
We can’t build and deliver
The risk is that a business can’t
get access to key resources
(technology, IP, brand, etc.),
can’t develop capabilities to
perform key activities, or can’t
find key partners to build and
scale the value proposition.

The risk is that a business can’t
generate successful revenue
streams, that customers are
unwilling to pay (enough), or
that the costs are too high to
make a sustainable profit.

Team Design
What kind of team do we need
to create our business?
Having worked with teams all around the
world, we have learned that behind every
successful new venture is a great team. If
you are at a startup, the founding team is
the glue that holds it all together. If you are
in a corporation, you’ll still need a solid team
to create a new business venture. If you
are a solopreneur, the team you eventually
bring in will make or break your business.

Cross-Functional Skillset
A cross-functional team has all the core
abilities needed to ship the product and
learn from customers. A common basic
example of a cross-functional team consists of design, product, and engineering.
Adapted from Jeff Patton.

Access to Missing Skillsets
If you do not have all of the skills needed
or are unable to partner with external
team members, then evaluate technological tools to fill the void.

• Create landing pages
• Design logos
• Run online ads
• And more...
All with little or no expertise needed.
Entrepreneurial Experience
It’s not a coincidence that successful
businesses benefit from those who already
have entrepreneurial experience.
Many entrepreneurs needed several
attempts before finding success. Rovio’s
hit game, Angry Birds, was preceded by
six years and 51 failed games.

Diversity
Team member diversity means they vary
in aspects such as race, ethnicity, gender,
age, experience, and thought. Now, more
than ever, new businesses have real world
impact on people and society. If the people
who make up your team all have similar
life experiences, thoughts, and appearance, then it can make it very difficult to
navigate uncertainty.
A lack of diverse experiences and perspectives on a team will result in baking your
biases right into the business.
When forming your team, keep diversity
top of mind, rather than as an afterthought.
Lead by example, by having a diverse leadership team. The issues that arise from
having a homogeneous team are very
difficult to rectify later.

SYNOPSIS

Team
Behavior
How does our team need to act?
Team design is necessary, but not sufficient.
You can have entrepreneurial experience,
but how you interact with your team needs
to exhibit entrepreneurial characteristics as
well. Team behavior can be unpacked into
six categories that are leading indicators of
team success.

Successful Teams
Exhibit Six Behaviors

1. Data Influenced

3. Customer Centric

5. Iterative Approach

You do not have to be data
driven, but you need to be
data influenced. Teams no
longer have the luxury of
burning down a product backlog of features. The insights
generated from data shape
the backlog and strategy.

To create new businesses
today, teams have to
know “the why” behind the
work. This begins with being
constantly connected to the
customer. This should not be
limited to the new customer
experience, and expands to
both inside and outside of the
product.

Teams aim for a desired result
by means of a repeated cycle
of operations. The iterative
approach assumes you may
not know the solution, so you
iterate through different tactics to achieve the outcome.

6. Question Assumptions
2. Experiment Driven
Teams are willing to be wrong
and experiment. They are not
only focused on the delivery of
features, but also craft experiments to learn about their
riskiest assumptions. Match
experiments to what you are
trying to learn over time.

4. Entrepreneurial
Move fast and validate
things. Teams have a sense of
urgency and create momentum toward a viable outcome.
This includes creative
problem-solving at speed.

Teams have to be willing to
challenge the status quo and
business as usual. They aren’t
afraid to test out a disruptive
business model that will lead
to big results, as compared to
always playing it safe.

Team Size

Growing the Team
You can begin this journey without a team, but as
experiments get more complicated over time, chances
are you’ll be adding to your team. Expect to grow
and evolve your team configuration over time, as you
eventually find product/market fit, build the right way,
and scale.

SYNOPSIS

Team
Environment

The Team Needs to be...

How can you design an environment
for your team to thrive?
Teams need a supportive environment to
explore new business opportunities. They
cannot be held to a standard where failure
is not an option. Failure will occur, but failure
isn’t the goal. The goal is to learn faster
than the competition and put that learning
into action. Leaders need to intentionally
design an environment where this can occur,
otherwise even an ideal team configuration
with the right behaviors will eventually stall
out and give up.

Dedicated

Funded

Autonomous

Teams need an environment in
which they can be dedicated
to the work. Multitasking
across several projects will
silently kill any progress.
Small teams who are dedicated to the work make more
progress than large teams
who are not dedicated.

It’s unrealistic to expect
these teams to function
without a budget or funding.
Experiments cost money.
Incrementally fund the teams
using a venture-capital style
approach, based on the
learnings they share during
stakeholder reviews.

Teams need to be given
space to own the work. Do
not micromanage them to
the extent where it slows
down their progress. Instead,
give them space to give an
accounting of how they are
making progress toward the
goal.

The Company Needs to Provide...
Access

Direction

Leadership
Teams need an environment that has the
right type of leadership support. A facilitative leadership style is ideal here because
you do not know the solution. Lead with
questions, not answers, and be mindful that
the bottleneck is always at the top of the
bottle.

Customers
Teams need access to customers. The trend
over the years has been to isolate teams
from the customer, but in order to solve
customer problems, this can no longer be
the case. If teams keep getting pushback
on customer access, they’ll eventually just
guess and build it anyway.

Strategy
Teams need a direction and strategy, or
it’ll be very difficult to make informed pivot,
persevere, or kill decisions on the new
business idea. Without a clear coherent
strategy, you’ll mistake being busy with
making progress.

Coaching
Teams need coaching, especially if this is
their first journey together. Coaches, either
internal or external, can help guide the
teams when they are stuck trying to find the
next experiment to run. Teams that have
only used interviews and surveys can benefit
from coaches who’ve seen a wide range of
experiments.

Resources
Teams need access to resources in order
to be successful. Constraints are good, but
starving a team will not yield results. They
need enough resources to make progress
and generate evidence. Resources can be
physical or digital in nature, depending on
the new business idea.

Guidance
Teams need constraints to focus their
experimentation. Whether it’s an adjacent
market or creating a new one, to unlock new
revenue teams need direction on where they
will play.
KPIs
Teams need key performance indicators
(KPIs) to help everyone understand whether
they are making progress toward a goal.
Without signposts along the way, it may be
challenging to know if you should invest in
the new business.

can be devastating later on, if not resolved
during the team formation and kickoff.
The Team Alignment Map, created by
Stefano Mastrogiacomo, is a visual tool that

In the design loop you shape and reshape
your business idea to turn it into the best

model. Your first iterations are based on
your intuition and starting point (product
idea, technology, market opportunity, etc.).
Subsequent iterations are based on evidence and insights from the testing loop.

The second phase of the design
loop is about synthesizing possibilities and narrowing the options
down to the most promising

2. Business Prototype
In this second step you narrow down the
alternatives from ideation with business
prototypes. When you start out you
might use rough prototypes like napkin
sketches. Subsequently, use the Value
Proposition Canvas and Business Model
Canvas to make your ideas clear and
tangible. In this book we use these two
tools to break ideas into smaller testable
chunks. You will constantly improve your
business prototypes with insights from
testing in future iterations.

1. Ideate
In this first step you try to come up with
as many alternative ways as possible to
use your initial intuition or insights from
testing to turn your idea into a strong
business. Don’t fall in love with your first
ideas.

Assess

3. Assess
In this last step of the design loop you
assess the design of your business prototypes. You ask questions like “Is this the
best way to address our customers’ jobs,
pains, and gains?,” or, “Is this the best way
to monetize our idea?,” or, “Does this best
take into account what we have learned
from testing?” Once you are satisfied with
the design of your business prototypes
you start testing in the field or go back to
testing, if you are working on subsequent
iterations.

Caveat
This book focuses on
Testing Business Ideas and
provides you with a library of
experiments to test your ideas
and business prototypes. If
you want to learn more about

1. Identify the Hypotheses
Underlying Your Idea
To test a business idea you
first have to make explicit
all the risks that your idea
won’t work. You need to turn
the assumptions underlying
your idea into clear hypotheses that you can test.

2. Prioritize Most Important
Hypotheses
To identify the most important hypotheses to test
first, you need to ask two
questions. First, “What is the
most important hypothesis
that needs to be true for my
idea to work?” Second, “For
which hypotheses do I lack
concrete evidence from the
field?”

Creating a good business hypothesis
When creating hypotheses you believe to be
true for your business idea, begin by writing
the phrase “We believe that…”
DEFINITION

Hypothesis
TEST

30

The hypothesis has its roots in
ancient civilization. The English
word “hypothesis” comes from the
Greek word hupothesis which means
“to suppose.” Some even refer to a
hypothesis as an educated guess.
Hypotheses are instruments you use
to prove or refute your assumptions.
For the purposes of Testing Business Ideas,
we focus on your business hypothesis,
which is defined as:
• an assumption that your value proposition,
business model, or strategy builds on.
• what you need to learn about to understand if your business idea might work.

“We believe that millennial parents
will subscribe to monthly educational
science projects for their kids.”

Be mindful that if you create all of your
hypotheses in the “We believe that…” format,
you can fall into a confirmation bias trap.
You’ll be constantly trying to prove what
you believe, instead of trying to refute it. In
order to prevent this from occurring create
a few hypotheses that try to disprove your
assumptions.
“We believe that millennial parents won’t
subscribe to monthly educational science
projects for their kids.”
You can even test these competing
hypotheses at the same time. This is especially helpful when team members cannot
agree on which hypothesis to test.

Characteristics of a good hypothesis
A well-formed business hypothesis describes
a testable, precise, and discrete thing you
want to investigate. With that in mind,
we can continue to refine and unpack our
hypotheses about the science project
subscription business.
–– We believe millennial
parents prefer craft
projects.

□□ We believe millennial parents prefer curated science
projects that match their
kids’ education level.

Precise
Your hypothesis is precise when you know
what success looks like. Ideally, it describes
the precise what, who, and when of your
assumptions.

–– We believe millennials
will spend a lot on science
projects.

□□ We believe millennial
parents with kids ages
5–9 will pay $15 a month
for curated science

How to Facilitate
Core team

DEFINITION

TEST

36

Assumptions
Mapping
A team exercise where desirability,
viability, and feasibility hypotheses
are made explicit and prioritized in
terms of importance and evidence.
Every radically new idea, product, service,
value proposition, business model, or strategy requires a leap of faith. If proven false,
these important and yet unproven aspects
of your idea can make or break your business. The Assumptions Mapping exercise is
designed to help you make all risks explicit
in the form of hypotheses, so you can
prioritize them and focus your near-term
experimentation.

Adapted from Gothelf & Seiden, Lean UX

The core team consists of individuals who
are going to be dedicated to making this
new business endeavor a success. They
are cross-functional. This means they have
product, design, and technology skills
needed to ship and learn rapidly in the
market with real customers. At a minimum,
the core team needs to be present when
mapping out the assumptions from your
Business Model Canvas.

Supporting team
The supporting team consists of individuals
who are not necessarily dedicated to the
business endeavor but who are needed for
it to be a success. People from legal, safety,
compliance, marketing, and user research
will be required for testing assumptions
where the core team lacks the domain
knowledge and know-how.
Without a strong supporting team, the
core members may lack evidence and
make uninformed decisions about what’s
important.

ASSUMPTIONS MAPPING

Identify Hypotheses
Step 1

Use a sticky note to write down each:
• desirability hypothesis and put it
on your canvases.
• feasibility hypothesis and put it
on your canvases.
• viability hypothesis and put it
on your canvases.

Best Practices

37
HYPOTHESIZE

• Use different color sticky notes for
desirability, feasibility, and viability
hypotheses.
• Your hypotheses should be as specific as
possible, to the best of your knowledge,
based on what you know today.
• Every hypothesis should be a single sticky
note. Don’t use bullet points; that makes it
easier to prioritize your hypotheses.
• Keep your hypotheses short and precise.
No blah blah blah.
• Discuss and agree as a team when
writing.

ASSUMPTIONS MAPPING

Prioritize Hypotheses
Step 2

Use the Assumptions Map to prioritize all
your hypotheses in terms of importance and
existence or absence of evidence that supports different types of hypotheses.

TEST

38

x-Axis: Evidence
On the x-axis you place all your hypotheses positioned to show how much evidence
you have or don’t have to support or refute
a specific hypothesis. You place a hypothesis on the left if you are able to produce
relevant, observable, and recent evidence to
support a hypothesis. You place a hypothesis on the right if you do not have evidence
and therefore will need to generate it.
y-Axis: Importance
On the y-axis you place all your hypotheses
in terms of importance. Position a hypothesis at the top if it is absolutely critical for
your business idea to succeed. In other
words, if that hypothesis is proven wrong,
your business idea will fail and all other
hypotheses become irrelevant. You place a
hypothesis at the bottom if it is not one of
the first things you’d go out and test.

Check the top left quadrant
against your evidence and
share it with the team. Do
these hypotheses really have
observable evidence to back
them up? Challenge the evidence to make sure it’s good
enough. Keep track of these
hypotheses in your plan going
forward.

Focus on the top right quadrant to identify which hypotheses to test first. This defines
your near-term experimentation. Create experiments
to address these high-risk
themes in your business.

Unimportant

To get started with testing
your business idea, you
turn your most important
hypotheses into experiments. You should start with
cheap and fast experiments
to learn quickly. Every
experiment will reduce the
risk that you’ll spend time,
energy, and money on ideas
that won’t work.

Every experiment has a specific run time to generate
sufficient evidence that you
can learn from. Make sure
you run your experiments
almost like a scientist, so
that your evidence is clean
and not misleading.

43

DEFINITION

Experiment
TEST

44

Experiments are the means to
reduce the risk and uncertainty
of your business idea.
The experiment is at the core of scientific
method. Like the hypothesis, it can be
traced back through history to everything
from how the vision works with the eye to
measuring time.
What has remained consistent over time
is that the scientific method is a valuable
method for generating insights.

Children naturally experiment and iterate
their way through problems. Once they
begin to progress through traditional schooling, experimentation gradually becomes
less and less of a practice outside of science
class. The way students are graded, judged,
and tested means they have to find the single right answer. In life, as it is in business,
there is rarely a single right answer. So over
time people optimize for being right, instead
of making progress, because they’re accustomed to being penalized for being wrong.
It’s no surprise that children raised in this
style of educational system become adults
who often struggle with the idea of being
wrong. The culture of rewarding who is right
and penalizing who is wrong extends into
their businesses. They’ve been conditioned
to look for that one right answer.
As you read this book and learn how to
test your business ideas, you will find there
is often not one path forward, but many.

As you experiment, think back to what
it felt like to be in kindergarten and preschool: when you were allowed to try to
fit the square peg into the round hole.
Experimentation is about structured creativity. Tap into that energy within yourself and
with your teams.
For the purposes of Testing Business
Ideas, the focus is on business experiments,
which:
• are procedures to reduce the risk and
uncertainty of a business idea.
• produce weak or strong evidence that
supports or refutes a hypothesis.
• can be fast/slow and cheap/expensive
to conduct.

What is a good experiment?
A good experiment is precise enough so that
team members can replicate it and generate
usable and comparable data.
• Defines the “who” precisely (test subject)
• Defines the “where” precisely (test context)
• Defines the “what” precisely (test elements)
What are the components of an experiment?
A well-formed business experiment is made
up of four components:
1. Hypothesis
The most critical hypothesis from the top
right quadrant of your Assumptions Map.

3. Metrics
The data you will measure as part
of the experiment.
4. Criteria
The success criteria for your
experiment metrics.

Call-to-Action Experiment
A specific type of experiment that prompts
a test subject to perform an observable
action. Used in an experiment in order to
test one or more hypotheses.

45
EXPERIMENT

2. Experiment
The description of the experiment
you will run to support or refute
the hypothesis.

Create multiple experiments
for your hypothesis
We’ve yet to work with a team who created
just one experiment, had a major breakthrough, and then went on to create a
multibillion dollar business from it. In reality,
it takes a series of experiments to generate
the possibility of a successful business. Use
the Test Cards and the experiment library to
create well-formed experiments to test your
business hypotheses.

can help you rapidly reduce the risk of
uncertainty. Instead of building internally for
long periods in a customer-free zone, you’ll
learn how to incrementally reduce your risk
over time. This allows you to build at the

1. Analyze the Evidence
Copyright Strategyzer

Evidence does not speak on
its own. Gather the evidence
you have from different
experiments for a specific
hypothesis and analyze it.
Make sure you distinguish
between strong and weak
evidence.

Copyright Strategyzer

2. Gain Insights
Insights are key learnings
you get from analyzing
the data. They allow you
to support or refute the
hypotheses you’ve been
testing. Your insights help
you understand how likely
your idea is to work.

Strength of Evidence
The strength of a piece of evidence
determines how reliably the evidence helps
support or refute a hypothesis. You can
evaluate the strength of evidence by checking four areas. Is the evidence based on...

Weak Evidence

Strong(er) Evidence

1.

Opinions (beliefs)
When people say things like
“I would…,” “I think _____ is
important,” “I believe…,” or “I like…”

Facts (events)
When people say things like
“Last week I _____ ,” “In that
situation I usually _____ ,”
or “I spent _____ on.”

2.

What people say
What people say in an interview or
survey is not necessarily what they
do in real life or will do in the future.

What people do
Observable behavior is generally
a good predictor of how people
act and what people might do in
the future.

3.

Lab settings
When people are aware that you
are testing something, they may
behave differently than in a real
world setting.

Real world settings
The most reliable predictor of
future behavior is what you
observe people doing when they
are not aware they are being tested.

4.

Small investments
Signing up by email to be
informed about an upcoming
product release is a small
investment and relatively weak
evidence of interest.

Large investments
Pre-purchasing a product or
putting one’s professional
reputation on the line is an
important investment and
strong evidence of real interest.

DEFINITION

Evidence
What is Evidence?

TEST

52

Evidence is what you use to support or
refute the hypotheses underlying your
business idea. It is data that you get
from research or generate from business
experiments. Evidence can come in many
different forms, ranging from weak to
strong evidence.
For the purposes of Testing Business
Ideas, we focus on your business
experiment evidence which we define as:
• data generated from an experiment
or collected in the field.
• facts that support or refute
a hypothesis.
• possibly of different nature (e.g., quotes,
behaviors, conversion rates, orders,
purchases…); can be weak/strong.

What are insights?
There is a difference between looking at
something and looking for something.
Evidence on its own will not help you reduce
risk in your business idea; therefore, we
recommend gleaning insights from the
evidence your experiments generate.
For the purposes of Testing Business
Ideas, business insights are defined as:
• what you learn from studying the evidence.
• learning related to the validity of a
hypothesis and potential discovery of
new directions.
• the foundation to make informed business
decisions and take action.

There are three dimensions
to help you determine your
confidence level:

DEFINITION

Confidence
Level
TEST

56

1. Type and strength of evidence
Different types of evidence have
different strengths. A quote from
an interview is a relatively weak
indicator of future behavior. A purchase in a simulated sale is a very
strong indicator of future behavior. The type of evidence you’ve
collected for a specific hypothesis
will influence how confident you
can be about the reliability of your
insights.

2. Number of data points
per experiment
The more data points you have, the
better. Five quotes from personal
customer interviews is obviously
weaker than 100 quotes. However,
those same quotes are likely to
be more accurate than 100 data
points in an anonymous customer
survey.

Your confidence level indicates how
much you believe that your evidence
is strong enough to support or refute
a specific hypothesis.
Not all evidence and insights are equal.
You should be more confident about your
insights when you’ve run several experiments with increasingly strong evidence
for a specific hypothesis. For example, you
might start with interviews to gain some first
insights into your customers’ jobs, pains, and
gains. Then you might run a survey to test
your insights on a larger scale with more
customers. Finally, you might continue with
a simulated sale to generate the strongest
type of evidence for customer interest.

How confident are you that you can support
or refute a specific hypothesis based on
experiments, evidence, and insights?
Very Confident
You can be very confident if you’ve
run several experiments of which
at least one is a call-to-action test
that produced very strong evidence.

3. Number and type of
experiments conducted
for the same hypothesis
Your confidence level should rise
with the number of experiments you
conduct to test the same hypothesis. Three interview series are better than one. Conducting interviews,
surveys, and simulated sales to
test the same hypothesis is even
better. You achieve the best results
when you conduct experiments with
increasing strength of evidence,
and the more you learn.

Not Really Confident
You need to run more and stronger
experiments if you’ve only done
interviews or surveys in which
people say what they will do. They
might behave differently in reality.
Not Confident at All
You need to experiment more if
you’ve only run one experiment that
produces weak evidence, such as an
interview or survey.

are exposed to more information in a year
than those in the early 1900s experienced

move so quickly that the insights you’ve

one experiment to find your way.
This is why we recommend a series
of ceremonies to create a repeatable
process. Each ceremony informs its
connecting ceremony, creating a
system.
This series of experiment ceremonies is a
result of years of experience working with
teams who’ve made business experimentation a repeatable process. We draw inspiration from agile design thinking and lean
methodologies.

In this rapidly evolving technical world of work, it’s no longer a
prerequisite that teams need to sit in the same room to be highly
effective. Whether you are co-located or distributed, we’ve
witnessed teams adopt these Experiment Ceremonies to help
propel their new business ideas.

TEST

70

Co-Located Teams
For Co-Located Teams, we recommend
having a space that is semiprivate. It can
be difficult to secure a conference room for
all of these ceremonies, and it would mean
bringing your artifacts in every time if they
are physically printed out.
Many teams we’ve coached pick a wall or
have a pod setup that allows them to quickly
collaborate and then get back to work.

Distributed Teams
For Distributed Teams, we strongly recommend video chat whenever possible. It’s
important to make a connection to your
team members and be able to see their
body language. Luckily for you there are
ample options to choose from in video chat.
When reviewing artifacts or conducting
exercises, try to use software that shows
people editing and moving things in real
time. This will prevent confusion and duplication from attendees.

Time Commitment
Based on a 40-hour week, the volume of cermonies
can seem overwhelming for your team. In reality, the
commitment outside of actually running the experiments is quite modest, and appropriately shouldered
by the core team.

accomplishment.
If you are using external contractors then their
attendance is optional, unless you anticipate that
their expertise will be needed for the upcoming week’s
experiments. Then it is recommended.

Daily Standups
Stay aligned and focus on your daily
work. Many experiments require
a series of tasks to complete, and
Daily Standups help coordinate your
day-to-day work.

TEST

74

Agenda
1. What’s the Daily Goal?
Create a daily goal. If your goal is to get an experiment out the door, then it’s important to align your
tasks to achieve that goal. Remember that daily
goals feed into your larger, more ambitious goals for
the overall business.
2. How to Achieve That Goal?
Identify the tasks needed to achieve the daily goal
and plan your day.
3. What’s in the Way?
Identify any blockers that would prevent you from
completing experiment tasks for the day or achieving the goal. Some of these can be addressed within
the standup if it is quick, otherwise meet after the
standup to work through it.

Corporate Team
Core members of the Corporate Team.
Have the Daily Standup in a location where others
can see you planning your day. It’s a great way to
socialize your process to the rest of the organization.

Solopreneur
Yes, even Solopreneurs need to plan out your day.
Daily Standups help you stay organized and aligned
with your bigger goals, even if you are not coordinating with external contractors.

inform your overall strategy.

TEST

76

Agenda
1. Gather Evidence
Gather up the evidence your experiments have generated. This includes both qualitative and quantitative
types of evidence.
2. Generate Insights
Look for patterns and insights from your evidence.
Even qualitative evidence can be quickly themed
using techniques such as affinity sorting. Try to keep
an open mind. You may find unexpected insights that
lead you to new paths to revenue.
3. Revisit Your Strategy
Take the new insights you have and revisit your
Business Model Canvas, Value Proposition Canvas,
and Assumptions Map. Make any updates needed
so that they reflect your current state of learning.
This is a crucial step in using what you’ve learned to
inform your strategy. If it feels awkward, don’t worry,
it’s a normal part of being an entrepreneur.

Biweekly Retrospective
Take a step back, breathe, and talk
about how you can improve the way
you work. In our opinion, this is the
most important ceremony. When you
stop reflecting, you stop learning and
improving.

TEST

78

Agenda
1. What’s Going Well
Take five minutes to silently write down what’s going
well. This gets the retrospective off to a good start as
people have space to speak positively about team
members and how they are working together.
2. What Needs Improvement
Take five minutes to silently write down what needs
improvement. These are things that aren’t going well
or could be doing better. It’s important to frame these
items as an opportunity to improve, rather than as a
personal attack against a team member.
3. What to Try Next
Come up with three things you’d like to try. It can be
one of the items you’ve previously discussed, or something completely new. This gives you a chance to try
out a new way of working that isn’t simply rooted in
what needs improvement.

Tip
There are plenty of
additional retrospective
options, such as Speed Boat,
Start — Stop — Keep, and
Keep — Drop — Add.
We recommend trying out
a few different formats to
see what works best for you.

Corporate Team
Core members of the Corporate Team.
For Corporate Teams, it’s important to detail what
you can control inside the team and what may be
outside your sphere of influence in the organization.
After the retrospective is completed, have a designated team member communicate any external
issues upstream to get help.
If you cannot get them resolved, try to find creative
ways to mitigate their impact on the team.

Solopreneur
For Solopreneurs, it can sometimes feel like an isolating experience. Take the time to reflect on how you
are working, even if it’s only you during the ceremony.
If you are unable to achieve the results you are
aiming for, then it’s a good idea to try new ways of
working to break through.
If you are using external contractors then they are
optional to attend, unless you want to check in with
them and improve how you are collaborating.

For Startup Teams, keep in mind that as you incorporate improvements into the way you work, it can help

Agenda
1. What You’ve Learned
Provide an executive summary of what you’ve learned
over the past month. This includes each Weekly
Learning Goal and any additional insights generated
from experiments. It’s important not to overwhelm
the attendees with detailed breakdowns of every
experiment. Have the information in the appendix to
dive deeper if needed.
2. What’s Blocking Progress
This is the time to review any impediments that
Stakeholders can assist in removing. This includes
items from previous Retrospectives that fall outside
your influence or control. These should be clearly
communicated as requests for assistance.
3. Pivot / Persevere / Kill Decision
Make your recommendation to Stakeholders on
whether you should pivot, persevere, or kill the new
business idea. This should be based not only on what
you’ve learned, but also what you see as a path
forward in your strategy.

Tip
The three major types of
pivots we witness are based
on the customer, problem, and
solution. You can stick with
the customer, pivot on the
problem. You can stick with
the problem and pivot
on customer. You can stick
with customer and problem,
and pivot on the solution.

Corporate Team
Core members of the Corporate Team and
Stakeholders.
For Corporate Teams, continue to communicate the
progress on what you’ve learned to Stakeholders.
Walk a balance between showing how you are working differently and making progress.
If the Stakeholders take the form of a funding committee, then decisions will be made during the session
on whether to fund the effort going forward.
Startup Team

For Startup Teams, you want to keep investors in the
loop on how you are making progress, even if that

You can choose to communicate this via an email
or video update, if your Investors are not physically
nearby.
Solopreneur

Principles of
Experiment
Flow
Running one experiment is great, but the goal
is to reduce the uncertainty in your business.
This means running several experiments
over time. You want your experiment process
to flow, generating the evidence needed to
make informed investment decisions.

PRINCIPLE #1

Visualize Your Experiments
Make your work visible
to yourself and others.
We’ve found inspiration from the lean and
kanban movements, particularly on this
principle. If you keep all this work in your
head, you’ll never be able to achieve flow.
Not only are your teammates unable to read
your mind, but much of flow requires you to
visualize your work.

1. Write down your experiments
We recommend only one experiment
per sticky, to keep things organized.
You don’t have to write down hundreds
of experiments — only the ones you feel
you’ll be running over the upcoming
weeks.

2. Draw a simple experiment board
This is one of the simplest forms of
an experiment board you can create.
We’ve been playing with this format for
quite some time and used to like the
“Validate” column, which we got originally from Eric Ries. Over time, we’ve
started to back off a bit on that language
because teams will set the bar so low on
their hypotheses that they’ll artificially
validate them and move on too quickly.
We prefer “Learn” over “Validate.”

3. Add your experiments to the
Backlog column
Rank your experiments from top to
bottom, where the top is the one you are
going to do next. Pull them across as
you begin to work on each, moving from
Setup, to Run, to Learn.

83

PRINCIPLE #2

Limit Experiments in Progress
Multitasking too many experiments
can often lead to trouble.
Teams inherently underestimate how much
work it is to run experiments, especially if
they’ve never run them before. So it should
come as no surprise that they often pull all
the experiments over at once and try to do
them all in parallel. This results in slowing
the entire process down. It’s also difficult to
extract insights from a previous experiment
to inform your next one.

Define work in progress limits for
your experiments.
For example, start with a limit of 1 for Setup,
Run, and Learn columns. This will prevent
the team from pulling a second experiment
over until the first is moved to the next column and finally archived.
In this example, the team runs the customer interviews before the survey, instead
of trying to do both at once (and slowing
everything down). The experiments flow,
using what you’ve learned to inform your
next experiment.

PRINCIPLE #3

Continuous Experimentation
Continue to experiment over time.
The last principle, which also finds its roots
in lean and kanban, is the idea of continuous
experimentation. A team that starts with the
previous board to achieve flow will eventually outgrow it. You don’t want the board to
artificially constrain the team from growing
and maturing over time. As we recommend
in the section on ceremonies (see page 80
and following), have a retrospective every
two weeks. This applies to your experiment
flow, which can yield interesting artifacts for
improvement.

Blocker Experiment
As an example, is that the team is trying to
line up customer interviews, but the research
department won’t let them. They state that
it’s against company policy to talk to customers. That is a “blocker” that’s preventing you
from making progress on that experiment.
It’s a good idea to identify and visualize
these, which will help you communicate
progress to stakeholders as to why things
are slowing down. It’s hard to achieve flow
when you are blocked.

Splitting Columns Experiment
Another example is that the team has
outgrown the initial board and is frustrated
that the Setup column doesn’t capture the
nuances of experimentation.
There is work setting up an experiment,
but then you have to run it, and if the team
is at capacity the experiment may sit
around for a long time waiting to be run.
When we talk about the board, it would be
great to see which ones are ready to be run
and which experiments are still being set up.

Ethics in
Experimentation
Are you experimenting with your customers or on them?

This book is about helping you determine if your business idea is
desirable, viable, and feasible. What it is not is a reason to scam people out of their money. Vaporware was a term that became popular
during the late 1980s and much of the 1990s. It described products
that never launched, but never really canceled either. Vaporware
products managed to get people hyped up, often promising unrealistic expectations. In more severe cases, people even used the lure of
vaporware to scam people out of real money. Our goal isn’t to recreate the vaporware environment of the 1990s. This is especially important in the era of fake news, when techniques can be weaponized as
propaganda to influence entire nations. Context is important when
using experiments to de-risk your business. In short, don’t be evil.

Experiment
Guidelines
Poor communication can destroy any experiment cadence you try to create. You can
address this by clearly communicating the
details and “the why” behind the experimentation. Teams who’ve done this repeatedly,
over time, find that they are repeating themselves quite a bit. To make things a bit more
efficient, they’ve crafted experiment guidelines to help communicate with those outside
of the team. This is particularly effective when
working with legal, safety, and compliance
departments.

1. Our customer segment is ________.
2. The total number of customers involved in our experiment is
estimated to be ________.
3. Our experiment will run from ________ to ________.
4. The information currency we are collecting is ________.
5. The branding we’ll use for the experiment is ________.
6. The financial exposure of the experiment is ________.
7. We can turn off the experiment by using ________.

SETUP TIME

1. Type of hypothesis: What type of
hypothesis are you testing?
Pick experiments based on your major
learning objective. Some experiments
produce better evidence for desirability,
some work better for feasibility, and some
are more appropriate for viability.
2. Level of uncertainty: How much
evidence do you already have (for
a specific hypothesis)?
The less you know, the less you should
waste time, energy, and money. When
you know little, your only goal is to
produce evidence that points you in the
right direction. Quick and cheap experiments are most appropriate for that goal,
despite the generally weak evidence. The
more you know, the stronger the evidence
should become, which is usually achieved
by more costly and lengthier experiments.

3. Urgency: How much time do you have
until the next major decision point or
until you run out of money?
The selection of the right experiment may
depend on the time and money you have
available. If you have a major meeting
with decision makers or investors coming up, you might need to use quick and
cheap experiments to quickly generate
evidence on multiple aspects of your idea.
When you are running out of money, you
need to pick the right experiments to
convince decision-makers and investors
to extend funding.

Rules of thumb
4. Reduce uncertainty as much as you
can before you build anything.
People often think they need to build
something to start testing an idea. Quite
the contrary. The higher the costs to build
something, the more you need to run multiple experiments to show that customers
actually have the jobs, pains, and gains
you think they have.

2. Increase the strength of evidence
with multiple experiments for the
same hypothesis.
Run several experiments to support or
refute a hypothesis. Try to learn about a
hypothesis as fast as possible, then run
more experiments to produce stronger
evidence for confirmation. Don’t make
important decisions based on one experiment or weak evidence.
3. Always pick the experiment that produces the strongest evidence given
your constraints.
Always select and design the strongest
experiment you can, while respecting
the context. When uncertainty is high
you should go fast and cheap, but that
doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t produce strong evidence.

Our work on experiments in
the discovery and validation
phases heavily build on
Steve Blank’s foundational
work in “The Four Steps to
the Epiphany and “The
Startup Owner’s Manual.”
We strongly recommend both
as essential reading.

Discovery
Weak evidence is sufficient
to discover if your general
direction is right. You get
first insights into your most
important hypotheses.

Execution

Validation
Strong evidence is required to
validate the direction you’ve
taken. You aim to confirm the
insights you’ve gotten for your
most important hypotheses.

SELECT AN EXPERIMENT

1. Go cheap and fast at the beginning.
Early on, you generally know little. Stick to
cheap and quick experiments to pinpoint
the right direction. You can afford starting
out with weaker evidence, because you
will test more later. Ideally, you select an
experiment that is cheap, fast, and still
produces strong evidence.

Experiment
Sequences
Go beyond pairing with
experimentation sequences.
Once you’ve turned your insights into
action, it’s time to move on and throw the
experiment away, correct? Well, not necessarily. As illustrated in the pairings for each
experiment, there are experiments you
can run before, during, and after. But what
about a sequence of experiments? Great
teams are able to gain momentum and
build up stronger evidence over time with
a series of experiments.

B2B Hardware Sequence

B2B Software Sequence

B2B Services Sequence

B2B hardware companies
search for evidence of
customers already hacking
together their own solutions
to a problem. They use this to
inform their design to do the
job even better. Then they test
it out quickly by integrating
standard components with
potential customers and
crowdfunding it if the signal
is strong.

B2B software companies
look for opportunities where
employees are mandated to
use subpar software. Many
have disrupted incumbents
simply by observing where
their deficiencies exist and
then designing a better
experience that solves for a
high value customer job, using
modern technology.

B2B services companies often
interview stakeholders to
research the cost of poorly
designed processes and services. They analyze customer
support data to see if this is
reflected in other areas within
the company. Afterward, they
create a brochure to communicate the improvement and
then deliver the service manually to a handful of customers
before scaling.

B2C Software Sequence

B2C Services Sequence

Consumer hardware companies have more options now
than ever before. They can
create Explainer Videos on
how their new product will
solve an existing problem,
then rapidly build using standard hardware components.
They can eventually crowdfund the build and distribute
to the customer through retail
or direct.

The rise of the Internet, open
source software, and tools
have catapulted new software companies into global
markets. Smart B2C companies use the words of their
customers in their content to
increase conversions. They
rapidly prototype experiences
and even deliver the value
manually before building the
product.

B2C services companies
start in a specific region by
interviewing customers and
looking for search volume to
determine interest. They can
quickly launch ads that drive
regional customers to their
landing page, then follow it
up with an email campaign.
Once they’ve conducted a few
presales, B2C services can
deliver the value manually to
refine it before scaling.

B2B2C with B2C
Experimentation Sequence
B2B2C companies are in a
unique position to use experimentation to inform the supply chain. Many companies
we work with go directly to
the consumer with their experiments, generate evidence,
and then use it in negotiations
with their B2B partners. The
presence of evidence helps
provide leverage, instead of
circular conversations based
only on opinion.

Contrary to popular belief,
highly regulated companies
can also use experimentation.
They need to do so within
the constraints of the system
and be mindful that not all
testing activities involve a
catastrophic degree of risk.
Companies carve out the
extremely high risk areas they
are not willing to experiment on and then go after
the places in which they can
experiment.

Cost
Cost is relatively low as customers may not
even need to be compensated. In general,
remote interviews over video have a lower
compensation than scheduled in-person
interviews. B2B interviews are typically more
expensive than B2C interviews, because the
sample size is smaller and may have less
free time.

EXPERIMENTS

Setup Time
Setup time for customer interviews can be
very short or take a few weeks, depending
on where your customers are and how
accessible. You’ll need to create a script,
find your customers, and schedule the
interviews.

Run Time
Run time for customer interviews is relatively
short: they only take 15 – 30 minutes each.
You’ll need to have a 15-minute buffer in
between each one to recap your findings
and make any edits you need to the script.

Evidence Strength
Customer jobs
Customer pains
Customer gains
80% average accuracy ranking on top-3
customer jobs, pains, and gains. You want to
be really dialed into your customer segment,
so set the bar high.

Customer feedback
Customer jobs, pains, and gains that were
not originally in your Customer Profile, but
were offered up by your interviewee.

Interview referrals
Referrals are an added bonus. It’s a good
sign if they occur and it’ll save you on acquisition costs for more interviews.
Customer Interviews are relatively weak
evidence: it’s only what people say and not
necessarily what they’ll do. However, they
are great for qualitative insights to inform
your value proposition and customer jobs,
pains, and gains for future testing.

Capabilities
Research
While customer interviews can be deceptively difficult to do well, the good news
it that almost anyone can do them with
practice. It helps if you have a research
background, but it isn’t required. You’ll need
to write the script, source candidates,
conduct the interview, and synthesize
results. A partner makes this all so much
easier — otherwise you’ll have to record all
of the interviews and watch them again.
Requirements
Target Customer
Customer Interviews work best when you
are focused on a narrow target audience.
Without a customer in mind, you’ll end up
getting very mixed results and conflicting
feedback. It takes much longer to interview
everyone, then back your way into a niche
customer segment. Instead, we recommend
you focus on a niche customer segment
before running any customer interviews.

Writing a Script
Scripts are a key part of conducting effective customer interviews, otherwise they
often turn into conversations that wander
and rarely extract the learning. You need to
de-risk your idea. We recommend building
your script after you’ve created your Value
Proposition Canvas and ranked the top three
customer jobs, pains, and gains.

Finding Interviewees
B2C Segment
We recommend creating a Value Proposition
Canvas for your B2C segment and then
brainstorming where you can find them
online and offline. Vote as a team where you
want to focus your search.

Sample Script
1. Introduction & Context
“Hello, I am [ name ] doing
research on [ idea ]”
“No pressure to make a
purchase.”
“Not going to sell you
anything.”

B2B Segment
Same exercise applies to B2B interviewee
candidates, although it may be harder to
brainstorm where to find them. Luckily there
are online and offline locations that, in general, work well for finding B2B interviewees.

2. Have Them Tell a Story
“When was the last time
you experienced
[ pain or job ]?”
“What motivated you
to do [ action ]?”
“How did you solve it?”
“If not, why?”

Screening on Craigslist
Craigslist is a popular website for posting
things to buy and sell, but it’s also a gold
mine for finding customers to interview.
Simply go to the Community -> Volunteers
section of Craigslist and post your research
request. In the description, include a survey
link for those who are interested in participating. The survey should include qualifying
and disqualifying questions.
For example, if you are looking for people
who own a bicycle, ask: “How many bicycles
do you own — 0, 1, 2, or 3+?”
If people answer 0, then it saves you from
interviewing those who do not own a bicycle.
If people answer 3+, they also might not be
ideal candidates because they own so many
bicycles. Simple screener questions like this
will save you and your interviewees hours.

Screening in-person
The offline version of this is very similar,
although you’d simply ask these questions
in person before diving into the entire interview. If they don’t qualify, thank them for
their time and move on.

Roles & Responsibilities
We recommend not doing these on your own
if at all possible, whether your customer
interview is online or in person. It’s very difficult and time-consuming to ask the question, actively listen, note body language and
response, and then ask the next question.
If you get permission to record the interview,
it’ll take twice as long because you’ll need to
watch and listen to it all again. Instead, we
recommend conducting interviews in pairs.
Scribe
• Takes notes.
• Writes exact quotes
when possible without
paraphrasing.
• Describes body language.
Interviewer
• Asks questions from script.
• Delves deeper when needed
by asking why.
• Thanks and wrap up.
Interviewee
• Answers questions.

111
EXPLORATION

Vetting Interviewees
Vetting interview candidates isn’t fail-safe,
but overall it’ll save you time by screening
out those who do not qualify for the interview process. One or two less-than-ideal
candidates will always slip through, but
it’s still better than not qualifying people at
all. One way to do so is a simple screener
survey to qualify people before scheduling
anything.

Debrief Topics
• What went well with that interview?
• What did we learn from body language?
• Did we bias the candidate in any way?
• Is there anything we want to quickly revise

Synthesizing Feedback
In addition to the 15-minute debrief, the
team should synthesize their notes and
update the Value Proposition Canvas to help
inform your strategy. One quick way to sort
through a lot of qualitative feedback is a
technique called Affinity Sorting.
Affinity Sorting
As a team, set aside 30 – 60 minutes and
bring your notes.
• Make sure there is plenty of wall space
if meeting in person.
• Write one quote per sticky note.
• Write one insight per sticky note.
• Place the interviewee name or initials
on the bottom of the sticky note.
• Place all stickies on the wall.
• Sort them into similar themes.

Updating Your Canvas
After you’ve synthesized the qualitative
feedback and analyzed rankings from your
first batch of customer interviews, go back
to your Value Proposition Canvas and make
any edits needed. It’s important that your
testing inform your strategy.

113
–– Talk more than you listen.
–– Pitch the solution.
–– Be thinking of the next
question to ask, instead
of actively listening to the
response.
–– Nod your head yes or no
while the interviewee is
speaking.
–– Ask only closed ended
questions.
–– Schedule the interviews
back to back, without any
time in between to debrief.
–– Forget to update your
Value Proposition Canvas
with your findings.

EXPLORATION

Ranking Analysis
Ranking isn’t a perfect science, but it’ll give
you a sense of how close you are to the
ranking in your Customer Profile. The drawback of having interviewees rank is that on
its own, you don’t know how much they feel
the job, pain, or gain, relatively, compared
to others. This is why it’s important to ask
follow-up questions and pick up on body
language.
If you’ve interviewed 10 customers that
match your Customer Profile, then ideally
you want the customer jobs, pains, and
gains ranking from your Customer Profile to
be at the 80%+ accuracy rate. Which means
8 out of 10 ranked job 1 as #1, job 2 as #2,
job 3 as #3, and so on.

Almost anyone can use A Day in the Life.
It will help if you have research abilities so
that you can collect and document the data

a partner when doing so to compare notes.
Requirements
Consent
A Day in the Life ideally requires consent
from those you are observing. It also
requires you to coordinate with management and security at the locations in which
you observe. For example, if you are going
to hang out at a retail store and observe
patterns, then speak to the manager first
to get permission. If you wish to observe
someone who made a purchase, ask them
for permission before doing so. Otherwise
this can become creepy and you may be
escorted out by security.

Closing the Say/Do Gap
Intuit’s Follow-Me-Home Program

I

ntuit creates financial, accounting,
and tax preparation solutions for
small businesses, accountants, and
individuals, such as TurboTax, QuickBooks, and Mint.com. Intuit is located
in the heart of Silicon Valley (Mountain View, California) and is well
known for pushing the boundaries of
customer-centric problem solving.

Can you give us a brief explanation of
the Follow-Me-Home Program at Intuit?
The Follow-Me-Home is one technique from
Intuit’s “Design for Delight” program, that
teaches our employees the skills required to
create awesome products for our customers.
Design for Delight includes three core principles: Deep Customer Empathy, Go Broad
to Go Narrow, and Rapid Experimentation
with Customers. The Follow-Me-Home is the
most powerful technique from the Design for
Delight principle, Deep Customer Empathy.
There is nothing more effective than observing a customer when and where they are
actually experiencing the pain and problems
we are trying to solve.
We teach the Follow-Me-Home technique to each and every employee in the
company, and each new person who joins
Intuit learns the technique as part of their
onboarding process. In fact, each new hire
conducts at least two Follow-Me-Homes
within the first few weeks of starting their
career at Intuit, regardless of their function
or level of seniority. From new engineers,
to seasoned HR personnel, to product
managers, to our most senior leaders,
everyone is expected to learn how do to a
Follow-Me-Home.
How did it get started?
Intuit’s founder, Scott Cook, was inspired
by a similar technique used by Toyota.
In the early days of Intuit, Scott suspected
he could use this technique to improve

Intuit's products, and so he began testing
the Follow-Me-Home approach while
building our early products such as Quicken
and QuickBooks. In those days software
was installed on a physical computer via
floppy discs (sounds crazy), so Scott and our
product teams asked real customers if they
could watch them install the software after
it was purchased.
Through observation, product teams
uncovered new insights, and complete surprises about how customers actually used
our software in the real world. These insights
often led to product improvements, so the
Follow-Me-Home principles were codified,
then shared with our employees. The FollowMe-Home technique continues to evolve
with the times, but the spirit remains the
same — go observe customers where they
are experiencing the pain or problems about
which you need to learn.
What’s your role in the program?
My team reports to Diego Rodriguez, Intuit’s
Chief Product and Design Officer. Our mission is to nurture Intuit’s culture of innovation, through programs such as Design for
Delight, our network of expert Innovation
Catalyst Coaches, and high-impact training. Our job is to ensure each and every
employee has the opportunity to learn and
apply the most effective innovations skills to
their daily work, such as Follow-Me-Homes,
and we continuously improve these skills as
the world changes.

How do you see programs like this evolving
in the future?
We’ve already improved our approach to
Follow-Me-Homes over the years, and we’ll
continue to do so as the world around us
evolves. For example, Intuit has an increasing number of customers all over the world.
We’ve adapted the Follow-Me-Home so we
can conduct them remotely, using video
camera and screen share technology. We’ve
also tweaked the approach to ensure we
respect the cultures and traditions of the
locations we visit. As the world continues to
get flatter, and technology changes, we’ll
continue to adapt our approach. However,
the spirit remains the same. Go observe for
yourself.

What advice would you give readers who’d
like to try this at their organization?
The simple answer is to just try it. Start small,
trying it yourself on a few projects so you can
learn what works and what does not work in
the context of your organization. Then you
build on what you learned to scale a formal
program, or just continue using the technique
yourself. You just might become the most
effective person in your organization.
People who read this book are familiar
with innovation best practices, so I simply
suggest you apply these best practices
to your future Follow-Me-Home program
as if it is a “new product.” Remember that
Follow-Me-Homes are just one of the many
skills required to be an effective innovator,
so Follow-Me-Homes won’t make you successful in a vacuum. You will likely need to
develop supporting programs, and a culture
which embraces these types of techniques.
The good news is Follow-Me-Homes and the
related skills are extremely fast to execute,
flexible, and much cheaper than a failed
product launch. Get out there and try it.
— Bennett Blank
Innovation Leader, Intuit Inc.

A DAY IN THE LIFE

What do you find most challenging about
training employees in this technique?
Techniques like Follow-Me-Home can be
learned by anyone, but just like any new
skill, it takes consistent practice to master.
In the early stages of learning people often
misunderstand the details of how to execute
a Follow-Me-Home, and it takes time for
best practice to become second nature.
For example, one VERY important aspect
of a great Follow-Me-Home is the focus
on observation, versus traditional interviewing — i.e., talking. We teach people to
focus first on what they observe a customer
actually doing in a real situation, using their
real tools, rather than overly scripting a
simulation, or asking questions. Once observation is complete, only then should you
ask interview-like questions, and when you
ask questions focus on the “why” behind the
observed behaviors, not speculation or opinions. When people first learn how to conduct
a Follow-Me-Home, they typically ask way
too many questions, and do not focus on
simply observing the behaviors in question.
That’s just one example.

We also know that not everyone is
comfortable “getting outside the building”
to speak with people who are complete
strangers. It does take a bit of courage to go
try a Follow-Me-Home the first few times, so
getting people over their initial reluctance is
something we focus on, as well as encouraging them to practice often. The good news
is that the vast majority of people tell us
Follow-Me-Homes are transformative, and
they often begin doing Follow-Me-Homes on
their own. They end up loving the technique.

Cost
Discovery surveys are not very expensive
and there are several free and low-cost
services that you can use to send them to
your customers. Much of the cost comes
from reaching the target audience. It gets
more expensive if you are targeting professionals or are in the B2B space. Your sample
size gets smaller; therefore you may end
up spending time and money to reach your
audience.

Setup Time
Discovery surveys do not take very long to
set up and configure. Many of the questions
are open-ended. It should only take a few
hours to a day at most.

Run Time
Much of the run time on a discovery survey
depends on the size of your customer pool
and how easy it is to reach them. It shouldn’t
take more than a few days, but could take
longer if you aren’t able to get enough
results.

Evidence Strength

# of free text answer responses
Insights
Look for repeating patterns in the responses
to the survey. By the fifth survey response
with a similar target customer, you should
start seeing the same thing written in different ways.

# people willing to be contacted after
the survey
Valid Emails
Ideally you have a small percentage, around
10%, who want to be contacted in the future.

Capabilities
Product / Marketing / Research
Discovery surveys require the ability to write
open-ended survey questions without
a negative tone. You’ll also need to be able
to identify the audience and interpret the
results by Affinity Sorting or using word
clouds to find patterns in the feedback.
Requirements
Qualitative Source Material
Surveys are generally more impactful when
you already have qualitative insights from
other methods that don’t scale. Use that
material to inform your survey design.
Access to an Audience
Getting in front of the right audience is just
as important as your survey design. If you
have an existing site with lots of traffic,
then you can leverage that to get to your
audience. If you do not have this luxury or
are going after a new market, then brainstorm channels to use before designing your
survey.

Cost
The cost of performing web traffic analysis
is relatively cheap, especially if you use a
free tool like Google Analytics. If you require
more in-depth, event-level tracking and
want to pay for a tool, they can vary widely
in cost. Some start out very cheap, but as
your customer traffic scales the cost can
increase with it. If you are looking for heat
map analysis of how people use the pages,
there are low-cost options for that as well.

Setup Time
Setup time to perform web traffic analysis
is relatively short, from a few hours to a few
days. You’ll need to integrate the tool into
your website and log into the dashboard to
view the data. Depending on the tool, it may
take a day or more for the data to appear.

Run Time
Run time to perform web traffic analysis is
unfortunately rather long, typically from
weeks to months. It largely depends on the
amount of traffic you have, but essentially
you don’t want to make large risky decisions
based on a few days’ worth of data.

Evidence Strength

# of sessions
Number of interactions with your website
within a given time frame, for a specific user.
Usually within a 30-minute period.

# of drop-offs
Drop-offs occur when a user drops out of the
flow you’ve defined. You’ll want to analyze
the percent of drop-offs at which step and
whether they left the site entirely.
How many customers you have on the site
and where they are dropping off is relatively
strong evidence, as it is measuring what
they do. You don’t know why they are doing
it until you ask them.

Amount of attention
Attention can be a number of different user
actions, usually including time spent on
page and where they clicked. Users don’t
always click on buttons and links, so having heat map data can give you amazing
insights into how you are gaining or losing
attention in your site.
Attention is also relatively strong evidence, and yet, like session and drop-offs, it
only tells you the “what” and not the “why.”

Capabilities
Technology / Data
The learning curve on web traffic analysis
can get steep rather quickly, especially once
you go beyond the basics of user behavior.
We suggest having the technical capability
to integrate the analytics software and the
data awareness of being able to analyze
the results. For example, the heat map data
will show you where people clicked, but
you’ll want to slice that data by source to
see if people coming from online ads click
differently than those who come from an
email campaign.
Requirements
Traffic
Web traffic analysis requires an existing
website with active users, otherwise you
won’t be able to collect any evidence.
Similar to the simple landing page, we recommend driving traffic to your site using:
• Online ads
• Social media campaigns
• Email campaigns
• Word of mouth
• Discussion forums

136

Cost
Cost is relatively cheap, since you are basically analyzing online discussion forums to
find unmet needs. If it’s your own discussion
forum, this should be relatively cost effective
and analytics may even be already built
into your software. If you are analyzing a
competitor’s or other community discussion
boards, you’ll likely be web scraping them
with low-cost tools or just doing it manually
yourself. You’ll save on the cost by manually
doing so but it might take much longer.

Setup Time
Setup time to analyze discussion forums is
relatively short. It’ll require you to define the
questions you want to answer and identify
which discussion forums to analyze.

Run Time
Run time for analyzing discussion forums is
also relatively short. It takes a bit longer if
you decide not to use a web scraping tool,
so we’d recommend automating it if possible
to shorten run time. You’ll want to look for
patterns of unmet customer jobs, pains, and
gains.

Evidence Strength

Types of work-arounds
Look for a pattern of work-arounds or ways
to hack the product to get it to do what
people need. This can provide insights into
improvements.
Similar to Steve Blank’s “built a solution
to solve the problem,” it’s strong evidence if
people are hacking together their own methods to solve problems the product doesn’t
fully address.

Types of feature requests
Look for a pattern in the top three features
requested on the discussion forums and
what pains and underlying jobs they could
solve.
Feature requests are relatively weak
evidence, in that you’ll need to perform more
experiments around the underlying job or
pain the proposed feature is intended to
solve.

Capabilities
Research / Data
You’ll need to be able to identify discussion
forums, gather data, and analyze it. In doing
so, it’ll help to be able to understand how to
scrape online websites and what questions
you’ll want to answer from looking through
the data. It’ll help if you have data and
research capabilities when doing so.
Requirements
Discussion Forum Data
The most important requirement for analyzing discussion forum data is having existing
discussion forums to analyze the questions
you need to answer. If you feel there are
unmet needs in a competitor’s product, go to
community and support forums where their
customers post topics. If you have your own
discussion forums, they should also be a
great source of data.

Pull-Based Approach
In contrast to push-based acquisition, you can take a
slightly different approach for those already seeking
a solution to the problem. You will need to get in front
of them when they are seeking it.
Pull-based acquisition means ensuring your experiment is displayed when people go online to search
for a solution to their problems. Using online search
advertising you can narrow in on the key search terms
and “pull” them to your value proposition as they
actively seek a solution.

DISCOVERY

Cost
Online ads can vary in cost, depending
on whether you are doing display versus
search, the keywords, and the average
cost per click for your industry. Overall
you should stay away from very expensive
online ads early on in your journey. You don’t
want to get addicted to paid acquisition and
have trouble scaling your business later on.

Setup Time
If your ad is text only, you can create it in
a few minutes. If your ad contains imagery,
it might take longer to find and create the
right image for the ad.

EXPERIMENTS

150

Run Time
Depending on the platform, it may take
1 – 3 days for your ad to be approved. Once
it’s approved, you’ll usually run your ad
for at least a week to see how it performs
day-to-day.

Evidence Strength
# of unique views
# of clicks
Click through rate = clicks that your ad
receives divided by the number of times
your ad is shown. CTR varies per industry, so
research online to see what a comparable
CTR is for your product.
Users clicking ads is a relatively weak
strength of evidence, but it it necessary
to test acquisition channels. It can also
be combined with conversions on a simple
landing page to make the evidence stronger
overall.

Capabilities
Design / Product / Marketing
Running online ads is much easier than it
used to be, mostly because online ad platforms give you a step-by-step experience for
managing them. You’ll still need to be able
to design an ad that conveys your value
proposition well, with the right call to action
and target audience. This means you’ll need
product, marketing, and design skills —
otherwise your ads will not convert.
Requirements
Destination
You are going to need a destination for the
target audience to visit once they click the
ad. Most of the time this is some type of
landing page. Platforms have become more
restrictive over the years, so the page will
need to match the overall value proposition
of the ad and meet the site’s ad destination
requirements. Be sure to review these before
running your ads, otherwise they’ll get
rejected in the approval process.

Cost
Feature Stubs are usually very cheap, since
you are not building out an entire feature
but merely the entry point for it.

EXPERIMENTS

158

Setup Time
It should only take few hours to set up a
Feature Stub in your existing product or
service. If it takes longer than that, you may
need to rethink your architecture when it
comes to implementing experiments.

Run Time
Feature Stubs should never be run for more
than 1– 3 days. They are designed as a short
experiment to quickly gather evidence.
Anything longer will frustrate your customers, since they’ll continue to expect it to
work.

Evidence Strength
# of unique views
# of button clicks
Button % Conversion Rates
You can calculate the conversion rate by
taking the number of unique views divided
by button clicks = conversion rate. Aim for
a 15% conversion on button click.
Button views and clicks are relatively
weak evidence, although they do signal
interest in the feature.

# of “learn more” clicks
Learn More % Conversion Rates
You can calculate the conversion rate by
taking the number of unique “learn more”
views divided by link clicks = conversion rate.
Aim for a 5% conversion on learn more click.
Clicking to learn more is a bit stronger
than simply closing the popup.

# of surveys completed
Survey Feedback
You can calculate the conversion rate by
taking the number of unique learn more
clicks divided by completions = conversion
rate. Aim for a 3% conversion on survey
completion.
Filling out the survey from the learn more
link is a bit stronger than closing the popup.
You can learn valuable insights from people
voluntarily clicking on and filling out
a survey on a feature they'd love to see in
the product.

Capabilities
Design / Product / Technology
You’ll need to be able design a button that
fits into the existing product. You’ll also
need the button to launch a window stating
that the feature isn’t ready yet and optionally asks the customer to fill out a survey.
Analytics will be important — you’ll need to
measure its performance.
Requirements
Existing Product
Feature Stubs require a product that
already has daily active users. If you don’t
already have one with a steady stream of
users, it will be difficult to gauge customer
interest. They have to see it in the context
of the product for the evidence to be
believable.
Integration and Analytics
Feature Stubs need to be toggled off and
on at a moment’s notice. Make sure you
have this capability and that it works before
launching one. In addition, you’ll need analytics to measure feature interest.

404 Test
Another faster, and somewhat riskier, variation of a Feature Stub
is the 404 test. It is very similar, except you do not put anything
behind the button or link whatsoever. Hence, the 404 test name, as
it generates 404 errors each time it is clicked. To learn if a feature
is desirable, you simply count the number of 404 errors generated.

This variant has trade-offs
since, on one hand, you can
test something as quickly
as possible at scale with

Endless Meetings
Have you ever been in a meeting where
team members debated over whether a
feature would be a good idea to build for
your customers?
Without evidence, the conversation goes
in circles, using only opinions for decisionmaking.
A Feature Stub will generate data to help
you gauge demand.
What if the test is a wild success and customers reach out to you asking when they
can use the feature? It then helps break the
circular meetings of opinion on the feature.
What if the test is a dud and no one even
clicks on it? Then it also helps move the
conversation forward.
It’s not so much about being right and
able to gloat in the meeting to your peers
that your prediction was correct, but instead
to use data to help move the conversation
forward. Making progress is far more important than being correct in these scenarios,
and a Feature Stub is a great way to make
progress.

Share, Discover, Discuss New Products
Product Hunt

P

roduct Hunt is a website that lets users
share and discover new products. The
website has grown tremendously over the
years since it’s inception in 2013. Product Hunt
has become the place to launch your new
product, but curiously enough it all started off
in a Philz Coffee as a 20-minute experiment
by Ryan Hoover, mainly using email.

Evidence
Opens, clicks and shares.
Within two weeks, over 200 people had subscribed to product discoveries from 30 handpicked contributors, consisting of startup
founders, venture capitalists, and prominent
bloggers.
Ryan also received several unsolicited
emails and in-person conversations expressing their love and support of the project.

Actions
Turning user behavior from email into
a platform.
Ryan used what he learned from the experiment to inform the design and technology of
Product Hunt as a community platform.
Since then, Product Hunt graduated from
Y Combinator (YC S14) and was acquired
by AngelList for a reported $20 million in
2016. It's become the place where makers
and startups launch their new product to
a global community of founders, journalists, investors, and enthusiastic people in
technology.

EMAIL CAMPAIGN

Experiment
Creating the first version of Product Hunt
as an email campaign.
In only 20 minutes, Ryan created a group
on Linkydink, a link-sharing tool built by
the folks over at Makeshift. At the time, it
allowed people to share links with a group
and send them out as a daily email. He
then invited a few of his startup friends to
contribute to the group. To promote it, Ryan
announced the experiment on Quibb (a
technology focused, online community) and
Twitter.

Insights
There is a there, there.
The response was overwhelmingly positive and unlike most email that is opened
and clicked (or not), Ryan had an audience
openly contributing and sharing links over
email. He had built up a network over the
years of hungry entrepreneurs and product
people. Clearly there was an unmet need of
a community for product enthusiasts, based
on the sheer volume of activity from his
email list.

You’ll need to incentivize customers (advocates) for making referrals, which will incur
cost in the way of discounts for both the
advocate and the customer (friend) being
referred. Low cost software can help you
manage referrals, so that you have analytics on how the program is performing.

You’ll need to configure your referral codes
and choose which advocates to send them
to.

Evidence Strength

Advocates are the customers you provide
referral codes to for sharing. The number
of shares is how many customers actively
shared the code with friends.
Advocate share rate is the number of

Target 15% – 20%.
Advocates agreeing to accept and share
a code is relatively strong evidence. They
are acting to refer friends to your product.

EXPERIMENTS

time for advocates to refer and for their
friends to decide whether or not to act on
the referral.

# of friends
# of friend clicks
# of friend conversions
Friends are the people who received the
code from the advocate.
Friend click through rate is the number of
friends who received the code divided by the
number who clicked on it. Percent varies by
channel. Target 50% – 80%.
Friend conversion rate is the number who
clicked on the code divided by the number
who used it to sign up or make a purchase.
Target 5% –15%.
Friends accepting the referral code and
converting is strong evidence. They are acting on a referral for an incentive, so it remains
to be seen if they will stay over time.

Capabilities
Design / Product / Marketing
Referral programs mostly require product
and marketing capabilities. You’ll need to
clearly communicate why you are offering
the discount and how your friends would
benefit from it. You’ll need design skills if you
have custom emails, social media posts, or
landing pages dedicated to the program.
Requirements
Passionate Customers
Customers usually do not start out passionate about your product. It takes time for
them to be satisfied and grow into passionate customers. Therefore, we recommend
that you gauge this before randomly sending out referral codes. You’ll want to give
codes to those who you think will actually
refer their friends to your product and speak
to it in a positive light.

or weeks, depending on your ability to
model it out and your access to a printer.

Run Time
Run time for a 3D print is relatively short.
You’ll want customers interacting with
the prototype to better understand the
fit between your value proposition and
customer jobs, pains, and gains.

Evidence Strength

Customer jobs
Customer pains
Customer gains
Customer jobs, pains, and gains and how the
prototype could solve for them.
The evidence is relatively weak evidence — they need to suspend belief and
imagine using it in real world scenarios.

Customer feedback
Customer Quotes
Take note of additional quotes from the customers that are not limited to customer jobs,
pains, and gains.
Customer quotes are relatively weak, but
helpful for context and qualitative insights
for upcoming experiments.

Capabilities
Design / Technology
You’ll need to be able to model the 3D print
in software, then create it using a 3D printer.
Some software is easier to learn that others,
but the learning curve can be quite steep
if you don’t have a design background. We
suggest getting help from a 3D modeling
expert. With regards to 3D printers, don’t
rush out and purchase one. Maker spaces
and workshops usually allow members to
rent time for creating 3D prints.
Requirements
Sketches to Model
Before planning to create a 3D print, make
sure you’ve spent time testing faster, lower
fidelity experiments. For example, you
should have at least placed paper prototypes in front of customers to receive feedback. That feedback should help inform your
design and solution. It doesn’t necessarily
mean you make all of the changes customers requested.

3D Printing with CubeSats
The National Security Agency

T

he National Security Agency (NSA) is a
world leader in cryptology (the art and
science of making and breaking codes)
that helps protect sensitive national security information, even in space! If you’re like
most people, the word “satellite” conjures up
images of a bus-sized object weighing several tons and costing hundreds of millions of
dollars orbiting the Earth for several years.

Hypothesis
The NSA team believed that…
Resisting the urge to start building an early
version of their encryption device, these
intrapreneurs “got out of the building” to
validate the desirability of their product.
Finding broad demand for CubeSat encryption by external customers, they sought to
determine if they could get the “buy-in” of
some key internal stakeholders who unfortunately didn’t see the need for a new solution.
If we can help them see the need, thought
the entrepreneurs, then they will authorize
and fund our project.

Evidence
The stakeholders immediately saw the need
for a new solution after seeing how the
currently certified encryption product simply
wouldn’t fit in the 3D printed mock-up!

3D PRINT

Experiment
The team set out to devise a way to help
these stakeholders quickly and unequivocally see the need for a new solution. After
a few failed attempts, the team and their
coach wondered if using a 3D-printer to
create a life-sized mockup of the CubeSat
might help them see it. They were ready
the next day!

181

Actions
The team was resourced, and they confidently began building their solution that will
be tested in orbit in 2019.

DISCUSSION PROTOTYPES

CubeSats, on the other hand, are a newer
type of satellite that measure only 10 cm
× 10 cm × 11.35 cm, weigh less than 2 kg,
and utilize commercial off-the-shelf components. An Innovation Corps (I-Corps) team
from NSA’s Cybersecurity Solutions Group
had an idea for creating a new type of
cryptographic device to secure uplink and
downlink communications from CubeSats.
Their solution had dramatically smaller size,
weight, power, and price characteristics as
compared to existing products designed and
certified for use with those expensive bussized satellites.

Cost
Paper prototypes are very cheap. You are
sketching out what the solution could be and
simulating the experience with paper. Your
paper prototype should not be an expensive
endeavor. If you purchase stencils or apps
to assist in the process it can add a small
amount of cost.

EXPERIMENTS

184

Setup Time
Setup time for a paper prototype is relatively short. It should only take a few hours
to a few days to create your paper prototype. It’ll most likely take you longer to find
customers to test with than to create the
paper prototype itself.

Run Time
Run time for a paper prototype is also a few
days to a week. You’ll want to rapidly test
the paper prototype with target customers,
to get feedback on the value proposition
and flow of the solution.

Evidence Strength

Cost
Physical brochure costs are low if you can

Setup Time
If you have the skills, a brochure should only
take 1–2 days to set up and create. This
includes the time needed to define the brochure hypothesis, pull in concepts from your
Value Proposition Canvas, write the content,
and include the graphics. If you do not have
the skills, it can take 1–2 weeks instead.

EXPERIMENTS

196

Run Time
Testing your brochure with customers is
generally quick and only takes about 15

Evidence Strength
# of brochure views
# of brochures taken

Email % Conversion Rates
Phone % Conversion Rates
You can calculate the conversion rate by
taking the number people given a brochure
divided by number who took action =
conversion rate.
Brochure conversion rates vary by industry and segment; however, if you target a
very specific segment for your brochure,
you should look for a strong signal of 15% or
more on the call-to-action conversion.
When customers take action to reach out,
it’s a good signal that you are on the right
path. This is different than a landing page
where people are giving up their email. On a
brochure with a call to action, it takes more
initiative on the customer’s side to take the
brochure home, read through it, and then
call or email you to find out more about the
value proposition you are offering.

Capabilities
Marketing / Research
Brochures require design skills to create
a compelling visual experience, with high
quality images and styling. If you are unable
to do so, you may get false negatives in
your testing — people won’t believe your
value proposition is real. The other important aspect of the brochure is the copy and
content. You’ll need to be able to write clear,
concise sentences that resonate with your
customers.
Requirements
Acquisition Plan
Brochures are different than online digital
experiments — you need to physically interact with people to distribute them. Have a
plan about what you are trying to achieve
and where to find your customers before
finalizing a brochure. Brainstorm locations to
visit, such as:
• Conferences.
• Meetups.
• Events.
• Cafes.
• Stores.
• Door-to-door.

A New Type of Insurance
Farm and Ranch Insurance

A

merican Family Insurance is a private
mutual company that focuses on property, casualty, and auto insurance. As an
insurance company, they understand risk
very well and do not want to build complex
insurance offerings that no one will buy. In
this example, the Commercial Farm Ranch
division was searching for fit for new market
risk protection offerings.

Experiment
Going analog with physical brochures.
The team went to a farming trade show
in Missouri and handed out professional
physical marketing brochures with a clearly
articulated value proposition and solution.
They had a call to action of getting in touch
with the team via a phone call or email for
more information.
The team screened for small/mid-sized
cattle and corn farmers.
Their target metric was that 20% of the
target farmers (small/mid sized cattle or
corn farmers) would take initiative and call
or email.

Insights
Segmenting different types of farmers
for a stronger value proposition.
Cattle farmers’ pain points seemed greater
based on metrics and emotion in conversations compared to corn farmers.
The farmers’ current way to solve the
problem was to go to a bank and get
another loan/line of credit but that felt risky
to them.
Several farmer focused banks/credit
unions were interested in the the concept.
The team could explore this as a channel.

Actions
Narrowing in on cattle farmers.
The team refined the value proposition and
marketing to be more cattle-farmer specific.
Next they reran the experiment to see if
focusing on a more niche customer segment
would get a more decisive validation signal.

Run Time
Run time for Explainer Videos is relatively
long, from several weeks to months, unless
it goes viral. While viral videos get a lot of

is too risky to rebrand a competitor’s product entirely for
customer testing purposes.
The technique usually
involves creating a clone of
the competitor’s, stripping
away the branding and
replacing it with your branding, or a fabricated brand.
This has legal and ethical
implications which we advise
against, especially for established corporations or those
operating in heavily regulated
environments.
Interestingly enough, we’ve
seen both corporations and
startups use Boomerang testing with branding intact to get
an idea of unmet needs.
Corporations have pointed
their Boomerang testing at a
hot up-and-coming startup.
Startups have pointed
their Boomerang testing
at entrenched established
corporations.

BOOMERANG

OVERVIEW

DETAILS

Cost
Boomerang is a low cost experiment involving pointing people to your competitor’s
product and not building anything. Any
incurred costs would be associated with
sourcing people to test with and recording
the sessions.

Evidence Strength

Task completion
Time to complete the task
Task completion rate = tasks completed
divided by tasks attempted.

DISCOVERY

Average time to complete a task.

EXPERIMENTS

206

Setup Time
Setup time for a Boomerang is short, in that
you only need to find and schedule people
to participate in the test.

Run Time
Run time for a Boomerang is short, as the
sessions should not last more than 30
minutes each. Even if you schedule several
of these, it should only take a few days to
complete.

In the evidence you are looking for unmet
gaps and needs when it comes to the
espoused value proposition versus what it
really takes for an average customer.
Evidence for measuring tasks in existing
competitors’ products is relatively strong —
you are measuring actual behavior in the
product.

Customer feedback
Customer quotes with regards to ease of use
and unmet needs.
Look for gaps in what the customer wants
and expects the product to do versus what it
does in reality.
Customer feedback is relatively weak evidence, but it is helpful in determining unmet
needs to explore.

Capabilities
Product / Marketing / Research
Boomerang capabilities include the ability to
select an applicable product, craft a script,
recruit an audience to test with, record the
sessions, and synthesize the results. Many
of these capabilities reside within product
and marketing and research. Like interviews,
these are best performed in pairs when
possible.
Requirements
Existing Product
Before you schedule a Boomerang experiment, you’ll need to identify the existing
product to use for the testing. It needs to be
a product from which you can extract
learning to inform your new idea, otherwise
the feedback you’ll collect will not be useful.

EXPERIMENTS

210

Setup Time
Setup time for Pretend to Own is a few minutes to a few hours. You don’t want to iterate
on the design internally very much at all, but
instead have the bare bones shape and user
interface.

Run Time
Run time for Pretend to Own can be several
weeks to several months, depending on the
nature of your idea. You’ll want to test it
over time, in order to forget that it isn’t real
(almost).

Evidence
When do you use it?
Engagement Logbook
Keep a spreadsheet that tracks the amount
of time it was available and the number of
occurrences in which you thought it would be
of use to you.
Document the types of uses and in what
scenarios they occurred. Overall engagement is a relatively weak strength of
evidence, but you’ll learn firsthand insights
that can help shape the idea and value
proposition.

Capabilities
Design / Research
Basic design and research skills are helpful
when running a Pretend to Own experiment.
You’ll need to be able to create a rough
replica and then log your activities over

B

efore the Palm Pilot was created, Jeff
Hawkins wanted to gauge the desirability
of the product. He had seen personal digital
assistants in the past that were feasible, but
not desirable. These ultimately led to large
expensive failures.

• Carried the device in my pocket
95% of the time
• Pulled it out to use it an average
of 12 times
• For scheduling appointments:
55% of the time
• To look up phone numbers or addresses:
25% of the time
• To add to or check a to-do list:
15% of the time
• To take notes: 5% of the time
Adapted from The Right It by Alberto Savoia

□□ Create your nonfunctioning
replica as soon as possible
in the design process.
□□ Be thrifty and use low cost,
commonly available craft
materials.
□□ Use your creative inspiration to pretend it functions
in real life.
□□ Keep a logbook of your
interactions, whether they
be physical or digital.

–– Spend a lot of money and
time creating the replica.
–– Choose extremely large
and expensive products for
this technique.
–– Be embarrassed to carry
it around in real world
scenarios.
–– Forget to have fun in the

DISCUSSION PROTOTYPES

Jeff Hawkins cut a block of wood to fit the
overall size of the envisioned product and
printed out a simple user interface, like the
one he envisioned. He taped the printout
over the wooden block and used a wooden
chopstick as the stylus. This was rough
enough that it only took hours to create. He
then carried it around in his pocket at work
for months to determine the desirability of
the value proposition in the real world.
When someone asked for a meeting or
email, he would pull the wood block out of
his pocket, tap on it with the chopstick and
then put it away.
After several instances when he felt it
would’ve been useful to have the real product, only then did he decide to go forward
with the product development of the Palm
Pilot.

OVERVIEW

1. Recruit

3. Facilitate

4. Analyze

□□ Recruit 15–20 customers
who use your existing product for the exercise.

□□ Give each customer a few
minutes to think before
writing down anchors. After
they’ve placed them near
the speed boat, note their
location. Anchors that are in
groups, repeating the same
thing in different ways, are
clustered together. If they
are deeper below the speed
boat, then it means they
are slowing things down
more so than others. Be
mindful to review each card
with the group, but refrain
from trying to solve or
provide feedback. Doing so
will bias the group and the
exercise.

□□ Once Speed Boat has concluded and the customers
have left, assign a severity
and urgency to each anchor
as a team. Some you may
want to address right away
while others you may ignore
entirely. These results,
after you’ve processed
the anchors, should be
inputs into your upcoming
experiments.

2. Prepare
□□ If it’s in person, you’ll want
a picture of a speed boat
and cards. If it’s remote,
then you’ll need to set up a
virtual whiteboard that has
a speed boat and virtual

Cost
Running a Speed Boat experiment is relatively cheap. The materials you need are

Setup Time
Setup time for Speed Boat is relatively short,
in that you’ll need to recruit customers to
participate. You’ll also want to review any
existing support data that could help inform
what to look for during the experiment.

Evidence

# of severe and urgent anchors
The higher number of severe and urgent
anchors, the bigger gap you have between
your Value Map and your Customer Profile.
Artifacts produced by Speed Boat are still
relatively weak evidence, but it’s stronger
than simply talking to customers. You are
unpacking what specifically is keeping
your product from living up to its value
proposition.

EXPERIMENTS

Run Time
Run time for Speed Boat is very short. It
takes 1–2 hours to facilitate with multiple
customers involved.

Customer feedback
Customer Quotes
In addition to the anchors, you’ll want to
collect customer quotes to better understand their context when struggling with
the product.
Customer quotes are relatively weak
evidence, but helpful for context and qualitative insights on your product.

Capabilities
Design / Product / Technology
In addition to facilitation capabilities, which
are not necessarily role specific, you’ll
need the right people in the room to assign
severity and urgency to the anchors. Not all
anchors are created equal, and some you’ll
want to fix right away while others you may
ignore entirely.
Requirements
Facilitation Skills
Speed Boat requires some degree of facilitation skills, especially with a group of
customers who are about to complain about
your product. You’ll need to check your ego
at the door and have the skills to extract the
specific anchors. If you feel you are unable
to do so because you are too close to the
product, then we recommend bringing in
a neutral third-party facilitator to lead the
session.

EXPERIMENTS

238

Setup Time
Setup time for a clickable prototype is relatively short. It should only take a day or two
to create your clickable prototype.

Run Time
Run time for a clickable prototype is also
short, as in a few days to a week. You’ll want
to rapidly test the clickable prototype with
target customers, to get feedback on the
Value Proposition and flow of the solution.

Evidence

Task completion
Task completion percentage.
Time to complete tasks.
Manual task completion is not necessarily
strong evidence, but it is a bit stronger than
using paper and will provide glimpses into
where customers could get confused.

Customer feedback
Customer quotes on the Value Proposition
and usefulness of the imagined solution.
Customer quotes on clickable prototypes
are relatively weak evidence, but stronger
than feedback on paper prototype
experiments.

Capabilities
Design / Product / Technology / Research
In addition to a digital product idea, you’ll
need design skills to create the appearance
of the product in a prototype tool or template.
It’ll require you to create hot zones that link
to other mocked up screens once clicked.
You’ll also want to write a script and have
the sessions recorded.
Requirements
A Digital Product Idea
Clickable prototyping requires that your
idea be digital in nature, since your audience
will be clicking through a digital experience
on a screen. At the point at which you’re considering a clickable prototype, you should
have a strong opinion on what the flow of
the product should look like, but still be open
to it being wrong.

Cost
Single Feature MVPs are a bit more expensive then low fidelity experiments, because
you're creating a higher fidelity version that
delivers value to the customer.

EXPERIMENTS

242

Setup Time
Setting up a Single Feature MVP can take
1–3 weeks. You’ll need to design, create,
and test it out internally before involving
customers. You are likely going to charge
for this version, so it’ll need to do one thing
really well.

Run Time
Running a Single Feature MVP experiment

want to run it long enough to analyze qualitative and quantitative feedback before
prematurely optimizing or trying to scale.

Evidence

Customer satisfaction
Customer quotes and feedback on how satisfied they were after receiving the output

VALIDATION

Cost
As long as you keep the concierge experiments small and simple, they are cheap to
run, mostly because you are doing all of the
work manually with little to no technology
involved. If you try to scale the experiment
or make it overly complex, it’ll increase the
cost.

Setup Time
Setting up a concierge experiment takes a
bit longer than other rapid prototyping techniques, because you have to manually plan
out all of the steps and acquire customers
for it.

EXPERIMENTS

Run Time
Running a concierge experiment can take
days to weeks, depending on how complex
the process is and how many customers
you involve in the experiment. It generally
takes longer than other rapid prototyping

Time it takes to complete the process
Lead time is the total time measured from
customer request to when the order was
delivered.
Cycle time is the amount of time spent
working on the request. It does not include
the time the request sits idle before action
was taken on it.
The time it takes for you to complete the
concierge experiment is very strong, in that
it gives you firsthand knowledge of the steps
needed to receive a request and deliver
value to a customer.

Buying and Selling a Home
Realtor.com

R

ealtor.com is a real estate listings website operated by Move, Inc. out of Santa
Clara, California. It provides buyers and
sellers with the information, tools and professional expertise they need throughout
the home journey.

Experiment
Concierge delivery of PDF insights.
The team did a simple concierge experiment
that was triggered by a call to action. When
clicked, the modal window highlighting a
value proposition for insights on timing your
ability to buy and sell at the same time
appeared. Users would then click through
a series of questions. Once complete, Dave
Masters (the product manager) manually
created the output by piecing together
insights from other parts found throughout
Realtor.com into a PDF.

Evidence
80 signups in just a few minutes.
It surpassed expectations quite quickly.
Based on site statistical data, the team had
estimated that it would generate 30 signups
within 3 hours. It generated more than 80
signups in a few minutes, faster than they
could even shut it off.

Actions
Persevere by testing in app features.
Knowing the audience mix was roughly
the size anticipated, the team felt confident
in moving forward with more experiments
targeting these users within this app. In fact,
the very next experiment was a feature stub
that included a link to a nonexistent tab
for “Selling-Tools” — a place that the team
would begin to put Seller specific features
and tests.

CONCIERGE

Hypothesis
The realtor.com team believed that sellers
on their site who are looking to sell within
the next year will also be buying at the
same time.

Dave would then individually email
these PDFs out to the users who signed
up. Additionally in his email to them, Dave
added a meeting link to further connect to
these users in hopes to learn more and see
how we could help.

253

Insights
Hypothesis validated — audience has problem. The team learned that a reasonably
large pool of people within their site that
had the buying and selling problem.
The team also learned about the challenge with concierge testing. High volume
could be a good sign but might require you
to do a lot more manual work than you initially set out to do. It’s probably worth noting
that this type of work requires your ability to
execute for these users. When dual-tracking
work, you have to anticipate and set aside
appropriate time to deliver on this promise
and really aim to learn. With the copious
amounts of work you might have in your
day-to-day, it can be hard to manage it all.

INTERACTION PROTOTYPES

As realtor.com teams spoke with people who
were looking to sell their home, one of the
problems commonly heard was the struggle
with timing the process of selling a house
with buying a new one. When people move,
they end up moving to another zip code or
other cities or even other states.
The idea was to aggregate and show
the market insights for them with the two
markets side by side. Would that be useful
for them? Would we extend that into a real
feature?

Validating a Physical Space
Zoku

Z

oku is a hive of smart lofts and friendly
spaces based in Amsterdam and is viewed
by experts as the next evolution of Airbnb.
They provide a home base for traveling
professionals who are living and working in
a city for periods from a few days to a few
months. As is the case any time you create
a new market, the Zoku team has risky
assumptions about their business that
need testing.

Evidence
Gathering qualitative feedback on
the space.
People were the most enthusiastic about
staying when the space used stacking,
eliminating internal walls and circulation.
If the stairs are in, there is more living space;
if the stairs are out it becomes circulation
space for the sleeping area. This evidence
especially came out when they tested with
groups of 4–5 people at once.

Actions
Testing space flow with cleaning services.
Using what they had learned from the
Life-Sized Prototype testing, the team ran
another round of testing with cleaning
services for the unit. This helped them learn
about the service challenges, specifically
with the raised sleeping platform.

LIFE-SIZED PROTOTYPE

Experiment
Testing living spaces with customers.
The team built a Life-Sized prototype of
the micro-apartment to test with traveling
professionals to determine if they’d stay
for weeks and months. They sourced 150
traveling professionals, shuttling them over
from their workplaces, to interact with the
Life-Sized Prototype.
Travelers toured and stayed in the LifeSized Prototype. The Zoku team interviewed
them while they interacted with the physical
space, learning about what worked and
what didn’t in the design.

Insights
The experience of the space means more
than the size of the space.
The experiment helped the Zoku team
understand nuances about the prototype.
When stacked all the normal home elements
(sleeping area, storage area, bathroom and
kitchen) on to each other like Tetris/Lego, it
resulted in a distinction between secondary
space (functional elements) and primary
space (living space to move around and put
your loose furniture).
During the course of all the validation
rounds they learned that “the experience
of space” is different from the amount of
square feet and can be positively influenced
by clear sight lines through the furniture
(the shutters in the sleeping area), large
windows, and smart lighting.

OVERVIEW

DETAILS

VALIDATION

Cost
Landing pages are relatively cheap to
produce, mostly due to the fact that digital
tools have evolved and are much easier to
use. It’s one of the cheapest ways you can
test your Value Proposition at scale with
potential customers.

Setup Time
Landing pages can be deceptively difficult
to do, mostly because you are distilling
down all the customer jobs, pains, and gains
into short easy-to-understand statements.
Still, it shouldn’t take more than a few days
at most to design a landing page.

EXPERIMENTS

262

Run Time
Run time takes a few weeks, although it is
largely depending on the amount of traffic
you can drive to the landing page. If the
daily traffic is low (i.e., less than 100 unique
visitors), then you’ll need to run the test for
a longer period of time to gather sufficient
information.

Evidence
Unique Views
Time Spent on Page
Email Signups
You can calculate the conversion rate by
taking the number views divided by actions
= conversion rate. Email conversion rates
vary widely by industry but on average it’s
between 2%– 5%. For early stage validation
we recommend 10% –15% in that you want
to be better than average, otherwise why
create something new?
Email is a rather weak strength of evidence, in that everyone has email and they
give it out freely if even mildly interested.
It’s not difficult to unsubscribe or send
unwanted email to a junk folder.

Capabilities
Design / Product / Technology
Landing pages need to communicate the
value clearly and succinctly in the language
of the customer. You’ll need the ability to do
this well, otherwise it has the risk of generating false negatives. If you do not have
these abilities yourself, then don’t despair
because you are in luck. There are many
landing page services that have professionallooking templates that allow you to create landing pages using drag-and-drop
technology.
Requirements
Traffic
Landing pages need traffic to generate evidence, generally about 100 unique visitors a
day. The good news is that there are many
ways you can drive traffic to your landing
page, including:
• Online ads.
• Social media campaigns.
• Email campaigns.
• Redirecting existing traffic.
• Word of mouth.

CALL TO ACTION

Branding Concerns
Branding the landing page can become a
hand-wringing decision if you are part of a
larger corporation. Startups have the luxury
of testing without drawing attention, based
on their brand alone. They can launch a
landing page and when people sign up,
it’s rarely because of the startup’s brand.
Instead, people sign up because the idea
stands on its own merit as a solution that
can solve a problem for them.
If corporations keep the landing page
on-brand, with the corporate logo front-andcenter, it can make things harder for the
team. Branding and marketing reviews will
usually slow down the process by weeks, if
not months. People will visit the page just to
check it out because of the branding. It can
be difficult to sift through all of the traffic
noise to see who is really interested in the
Value Proposition.

CROWDFUNDING

OVERVIEW

DETAILS

VALIDATION

Cost
Crowdfunding costs are typically focused
around the video production, marketing,
logistics, and length of campaign. Even
though there are crowdfunding platforms
available, the fidelity needs to be high or
you will not garner interest from customers.

Setup Time
Crowdfunding campaigns can take a few
weeks to a few months to put together. It’s
not trivial to produce a compelling, high
quality video, create content that conveys
the Value Proposition, and structure the
pricing tiers and perks for your customers.

EXPERIMENTS

268

Run Time
Run time typically takes 30– 60 days for a
crowdfunding campaign to run its course.
This isn’t to say you won’t be wildly successful and fund it in less — just be aware
that those funded in a few days are the
exceptions.

Evidence Strength

Referrers
# of unique views
# of comments
# of social media shares
Where your visitors are coming from online
and how they interact with your campaign.
Views, comments, and shares are all
relatively weak evidence but good for qualitative insights.

# of pledges
Pledge amount
How your viewers are converting to pledges.
At least 6% of your pledges come from direct
traffic. At least 2% of your pledges come
from targeted online ads.
Percent funded. Ideally this is 100% and
your idea gets funded.
Viewers pledging their money to make
your crowdfunding campaign a success is
very strong evidence. They are voting with
their wallets, not just their words.

Capabilities
Design / Product / Marketing / Finance
Crowdfunding’s popularity has created a
rise in crowdfunding platforms, which means
you don’t need an entire development team
to create a campaign anymore. You’ll still
need to create an authentic campaign with
interesting perks, while building awareness
in the market. Design plays a big role here in
that it needs to look professional, otherwise
you may get false negatives on your Value
Proposition. Finance plays a bigger role,
in that you need to correctly spec out your
pricing tiers and perks in hopes that you
can build a sustainable business from the
campaign.
Requirements
Value Proposition and Customer Segment
Before jumping into a crowdfunding campaign, you’ll need a clear Value Proposition
that you can turn into a high quality
video and a target customer segment.
Crowdfunding campaigns without videos are
few and far between and their success rate
is quite low. You’ll also want to know how
you are targeting the customer, otherwise
it’ll be very difficult to drive people to it.

Cost
Split Tests are relatively cheap and online
digital tools allow you to perform them
without having to know much about
programming. You can copy and paste a
script into your page or app, then log into
the product and configure the Split Tests.
It resembles using a word processor, by
dragging, dropping, and typing. Split Tests
become more expensive if you are building
customized hardware or printing out mailers,
since you have to physically make two
different versions to test with customers.

Setup Time
The setup time for Split Tests is relatively
short, especially with digital products where
you can use existing Split Testing tools.
Setup time can be a bit longer if you are
physically making two different versions.

Run Time
The run time for Split Tests usually spans
several days to weeks. You’ll want to have
statistically significant data to gain insights
into which one performed better.

Evidence Strength

Traffic
Control A behavior
Control A Conversion Rate
Conversion rate is the number of people who
are routed into the Control A test divided by
number of actions. Use previous data if possible to predict what the control conversion
rate is for a baseline.

Variant B behavior
Variant B Conversion Rate
Conversion rate is the number of people
who are routed into the Variant B divided by
number of actions. Define what measurable
impact you’d like Variant B to have on the
conversion percentage.
Evidence strength is moderate — customers
aren’t aware they are participating in the
Split Test. You’ll want to have, at the very
least, an 80% confidence level in the results.
Ideally you’d want 98% confidence level,
but it can vary depending on what you are
testing. Use an online Split Test calculator to
help guide you through the process.

Capabilities
Design / Product / Technology / Data
You’ll need the capabilities required to
define what you’ll be testing, the expected
baseline for Control A, and the needed
improvement from Variant B. You’ll want to
design it visually to fit the overall theme,
otherwise you’ll receive false negatives. It’ll
require some degree of technology to integrate if it’s software. Lastly, you’ll need to
be able to analyze the results to help inform
your next experiment.
Requirements
Significant Traffic
Split Tests need a significant amount of
traffic to generate believable evidence. Your
traffic will be randomized to display either
Control A or Variant B to the customer. If you
have little to no traffic, it’ll take entirely too
much time to come to a conclusion that one
performs better than the other.

Cost
Presales are relatively cheap, but unlike
mock sales you have the additional costs
of processing the transaction and shipping
the product. If you are using a point of sale
system, then you may need to purchase
hardware or software. In addition, most
payment systems take a percentage of your
sales (2%–3%) and may charge a monthly
fee on top of that.

EXPERIMENTS

276

Setup Time
Setup time for a presale is relatively short.
Once you are close to shipping your product,
it requires the setup of accepting and processing financial information.

Run Time
Run time for a presale is a few days or
weeks. You’ll want to target a specific
audience with your solution and give
them enough time to consider a purchase.
Presales aren’t usually very long — payment
providers may require you to ship product
within 20 days of purchase.

Evidence

# of unique views
# of purchases
You can calculate the purchase conversion
rate by taking the number people who view
the price divided by the number of purchases.
Purchases are strong evidence.
Customers are paying for your solution
before it is generally available to the public.

# of abandons
Mostly associated with online shopping
carts, if people are beginning the purchase
process and then leaving, they are abandoning the sale.
You can calculate the abandonment rate
by dividing the total number of completed
purchases by the number of people who
entered the purchase process.
People dropping out of the purchase
process is strong evidence, albeit a bad sign.
It means something is incorrect with your
process, misconfigured, or the purchase
price is not appropriate.

Capabilities
Design / Sales / Finance
Conducting a presale will require defining
your price options. You’ll also need to design
the sale in such a way that it is the right
fidelity for your target audience. Finally,
you’ll need sales capability, especially if
you are conducting these in person in the
physical world.
Requirements
Ability to Fulfill
Presales are different than mock sales:

Ranking Customer Jobs, Pains, and Gains
Another popular type of validation survey
is validating the importance ranking of the
jobs, pains, and gains in your Customer
Profile in the Value Proposition Canvas. Most
teams take their best guess at this ranking
in a workshop setting, but need to quickly
get feedback from outside the building to
see how close they are to the real world. You
can easily do this in most survey software
today by creating two boxes, one for the list
and next to it one for the customer ranking.

Other Types of Validation Surveys
Validation surveys are, in general, very simple with closed-ended feedback responding
to a single question. With that in mind, you
can apply that to other types of assumptions

Sean Ellis Test
One type of survey is called the Sean Ellis
Test, which is named after it’s creator
and growth-hacking expert Sean Ellis. His
approach is to gauge desirability through
scarcity.
The Sean Ellis Test keys in on one important question: “How disappointed would you
be if you could no longer use this product?
Very disappointed, somewhat disappointed,
or not disappointed?”
It can be argued that you’ve not achieved
product/market fit until a score of 40% is
reached. If customers are apathetic and do

not care if your product goes away, then you
have a desirability problem. It doesn’t make
sense to scale before you have fit, otherwise
you can waste a lot of money scaling things
that no one wants.
Context is important when running a Sean
Ellis Test. If you run it as soon as the customer
experiences the Value Proposition, it can feel
very out of place and return skewed data
because they’ve yet to really experience the
product. Who is going to genuinely be disappointed if they’ve never really used it?
On the flip side, if you show this survey to
someone who hasn’t used the product in six

months, then there’s a good chance they’re
long gone and won’t even take the survey at
this point.
The recommendation is to show this
survey to gauge desirability with customers
who have experienced the core of your product at least twice in the past two weeks.

If it takes you 15 minutes to manually
create the value for the end customer,
ask yourself:

we perform manually each day?

We’ve witnessed entrepreneurs rush to
automate the solution and, in turn, prematurely scale. When you draw a line in the
sand to manually deliver the value, then
you don’t have to scale until that threshold
is exceeded. Some entrepreneurs exceed
it and and then turn to automation. Others
may never hit the threshold. For those who
never hit it, we recommend taking a step
back and re-evaluating the strategy.

you involve in the experiment. It generally
takes longer than other rapid prototyping
techniques.

Evidence

Customer satisfaction
Customer quotes and feedback on how
satisfied they were after receiving the output
from your experiment.
Customer satisfaction evidence is strong
in this case because you are asking for feedback after the value was delivered to the
customer, instead of a hypothetical situation.

# of purchases
Customer purchases from the Wizard of Oz
experiment. What are they willing to pay for
a manual experience?
Payments are strong evidence, even if
you are manually delivering value.

Time it takes to complete the process
Lead time is the total time measured from
customer request to when the order was
delivered.
Cycle time is the amount of time spent
working on the request. It does not include
the time the request sits idle before action
is taken on it.
The time it takes for you to complete the
Wizard of Oz experiment is very strong — it
gives you firsthand knowledge of the steps
needed to receive a request and deliver
value to a customer.

Capabilities
Design / Product / Tech / Legal / Marketing
You’ll need all of the capabilities to manually create and deliver the product to
the customer. This is very context specific,
depending on whether you are delivering
a physical or digital product or service to
the end customer.
Requirements
Time
The biggest requirement for a Wizard of
Oz experiment is time, closely followed by
a digital curtain. Like the Concierge experiment, you’ll need quite a bit of time to
perform the testing but in addition to this,
you’ll need a curtain to hide the people performing the tasks from the customer. This
can take many forms, but the most common
is a simple landing page or digital interface
where the customer requests and receives
the value.

DETAILS

VALIDATION

Cost
Mock sale is relatively cheap: you are price
testing your product without building all of
it. You’ll need a believable level of fidelity
for your target audience, so there is some
cost in presenting your solution digitally or
physically.

EXPERIMENTS

290

Setup Time
Setup time for a mock sale is relatively
short, meaning you can create a believable
platform for your Value Proposition in a few
hours or a few days.

Run Time
Run time for a mock sale is a few days
or weeks. You’ll want to target a specific
audience with your solution and give them
enough time to consider a purchase.

Evidence

# of unique views
# of purchase clicks
You can calculate the purchase conversion
rate by taking the number of people
who view the price divided by the number
of purchase clicks.
Purchase clicks are relatively strong,
although not as strong as subsequent email
and payment submissions.

# of purchase email signups
You can calculate the purchase email conversion rate by taking the number of people
who view the price divided by the number
of email signups.
Email signups after purchase clicks are
relatively strong, although not as strong as
payment submissions.

# of purchase payment
Information submitted
You can calculate the purchase payment
conversion rate by taking the number of
people who view the price divided by the
number who filled out payment information.
Payment info submissions are very
strong evidence.

Capabilities
Design / Sales / Finance
Conducting a mock sale will require financial
modeling skills to inform the price options.
You’ll also need to design the sale in such a
way that it is the right fidelity for your target
audience. Finally, you’ll need sales capability, especially if you are conducting these in
person in the physical world.
Requirements
Pricing Strategy
Mock sale does require some thought and
number crunching before you conduct the
experiment. This isn’t a scenario where you
simply ask people how much they’ll pay.
Customers are notoriously bad at answering
that question. Instead, you’ll need to be able
to present a sale price or multiple prices to
have them respond. If you test a ridiculously
low price, then you’ll receive false positives
on something you won’t be able to deliver.
Therefore, spend time thinking through the
cost structure to make the mock sale
evidence worthwhile.

Buffer

W

hen Joel Gascoigne, cofounder of
Buffer, started the company from his
bedroom nine years ago, he wasn’t certain if
people would even pay for his social media
scheduling service.
At the time, social media managers were
still manually logging into multiple social
media platforms and posting their content.
They used calendars and reminders to tell
them the perfect moment to log in and post
across time zones. This wasn’t ideal, especially
when it occurred in the middle of the night.

Experiment
Price testing different monthly fees to
gauge viability.
Joel decided to test viability by adding three
different payment tier options to the landing
page. Free = $0/month for 1 tweet a day and
5 tweets in your buffer queue. Standard =
$5/month for 10 tweets a day and 50 tweets
in your buffer queue. Max = $20/month
for unlimited tweets a day and unlimited
tweets in your buffer queue. These options
appeared once people clicked the “Plans
and Pricing” button. Once people clicked

Evidence
A $5/month signal.
The evidence showed that the $5/month
plan was the clear winner in this initial test.
This option generated the most email
signups when he compared it to the $0 and
$20 options.

Insights
People were interested in paying.
With the data showing the $5/month plan
being the most popular, it started to become
clear how people valued Buffer. They didn't
need to only schedule one tweet a day,
because they could simply log in and do
that. On the other hand, they didn't need
unlimited tweets because social media managers don't want to overwhelm their audience and be perceived as spam. The sweet
spot seemed to be 5 tweets per day, where
it was enough of a hassle that people would
pay a $5/month fee to address.

Actions
Evidence that Buffer should be built.
After generating evidence and insights into
the demand of Buffer, Joel decided to build
the application. He used this learning to
help shape his price points for launch. Joel
also kept it lean and manually processed
the payments for each customer early on.
Today Buffer is used by hundreds of thousands of customers around the world and
has a monthly recurring revenue of $1.54
million.

Hypothesis
Joel believed that people would pay a
monthly fee to schedule their social media
posts on Twitter.
It wasn’t enough that people would enter
their email without any pricing information.
Joel needed to know if it was viable.

an option, an email signup form appeared
stating Buffer wasn’t quite yet ready for
launch. Each option in the page had analytics integrated, so Joel could analyze who
was signing up based on the selected price.

293
SIMULATION

The Buffer application would solve that
problem, beginning with a scheduling service
for Twitter, before expanding to additional
social media platforms. Joel decided to
lightly test the desirability of the Buffer app
by adding a “Plans and Pricing” button to
his simple landing page. When clicked, it
displayed a message about not being ready
yet with an email signup to be notified.
After a few people submitted their email,
Joel determined there was initial interest but
wanted to collect more evidence.

To create a letter of intent it helps to have
basic legal understanding, even though it’s a
non-legal document. If using it with partners,
you’ll need to be able to articulate the key

For B2B customers, you’ll need to be able to

Warm Leads
Unless you have warm leads, meaning there

Thrive Smart Systems

hrive Smart Systems is a company set
on empowering people with the latest
in irrigation technology. Their wireless system saves you time and money, providing
smarter irrigation.

Hypothesis
Seth and Grant believed that they could
generate $25,000 during the test phase
through 20 LOIs.

Evidence
Generating over $50k in purchases.
The Thrive team found that with no advertising and by just asking potential customers
to fill out a form, they could generate over
$50,000 in projected revenue.

Insights
Expectations versus reality.
They also learned that the number of units
people say they will purchase is much more
than they are willing to put into writing.
Those who said they would buy 1000 units
only wrote down that they will buy 300 units.
A few who said they would buy 100 only
wrote down that they will buy 15–20. From
this, Seth and Grant gained insights into how
to formalize their purchasing process. Even
though the LOI is non-binding, when a potential customer puts pen to paper they have
more skin in the game.

Actions
Iterating on the LOI approach.
From the LOI experiments, Seth and Grant
refined their LOIs to two different flavors.
One being a “pledge of purchase” for those
who want to buy the end product. The other
flavor being a “testing agreement” for those
who want to participate in the beta test.
LETTER OF INTENT

Experiment
Asking customers to write an LOI.
They began to test this hypothesis by asking interested customers to write a Letter of
Intent for how many units they were willing
to purchase.
After receiving a few, they created a LOI
template to pass out to each person that
expresses interest in buying the product.

299
SIMULATION

The cofounders, Seth Bangerter and Grant
Rowberry, wanted to know if people would
buy their product before they completed
product development. Many people, landscapers in particular, expressed so much
interest that when they asked them how
many they would buy they would respond
with “a ton” or “as many as you can give
me.” While this was exciting to hear, Seth
and Grant wanted to get a firm number on
how many these customers were willing to
purchase.
The Thrive team chose to have interested
customers write a letter of intent to purchase.
The idea was to allow people to write down,
in numbers, precisely what they wanted.
Seth and Grant decided to make a template
to include vital elements that a letter
of intent should have. When a potential
customer stated they are willing to buy x
amount of Thrive’s product, then x amount
was to be placed on the letter of intent.
Thrive called this template their letter

Cost
Pop-up stores are generally small, but
will still cost more money than low fidelity
experiments. Much of the cost is leasing
the space and advertising, which can vary
depending on the location and access to
the store. You can bring costs down if you
can find an owner to give you extra space
in their existing store for the experiment.
Additional costs may include licenses,
permits, and insurance required in order
to conduct business transactions.

Setup Time
Setup time for a pop-up store can take days
or weeks, depending on what locations
are available. It’ll need to look professional,
which requires having the right people and
appearance for the store. You’ll also need to
create demand using ads, unless it is a very
high traffic area with your target customers.

T

opology Eyewear aims to solve the
problem of poorly fitting glasses, by
making custom-tailored glasses that are
sized and styled via an augmented reality
app. Customers can take a selfie, see how
different glasses look on their faces, and
then purchase custom glasses that are specifically sculpted to fit their unique dimensions. As with any new innovation, there are
risky hypotheses that need to be tested.

Experiment
Getting out of the building with a

The team rented a partially empty storefront on San Francisco’s Union Street for
a Friday and created a temporary company
name — Alchemy Eyewear — and commissioned posters and flyers to make it feel
exclusive and exciting. Chris Guest, the
marketing lead, went out onto the street to
cold approach strangers, ask about their
eyewear, summarize the pitch, and encourage them to visit the pop-up store. When
customers entered the store, Topology staff
would first ask them about the problems
they experience with their eyewear, taking
note of how they describe the problem in
their own words. Then they would introduce
our solution and note their response and
what questions they asked about it. They
would then demo the app using a default
face model and note their responses and
questions. They would then seek their permission to take a face scan so they could

Evidence

Despite humble expectations, after 2 hours,
they sold 4 pairs of glasses at an average
price of about $400.
The conversion rates on email signups
were too small to be meaningful in the
absolute sense, but they were helpful to see
where the biggest drop-off occurred in the
the process.

Insights
People knew their glasses didn’t fit,
but weren’t sure why.
Even though the team sold 4 pairs of
glasses, it was the qualitative insights that
were the most valuable.
The team noticed noticed that people
seemed to be “symptom aware” but not
“problem aware.” That is, when asked if they
had a problem with fit, most people would say
no. But when asked if their glasses slid down
their nose, pinched, created red marks etc,
most people would say yes. They understood
the symptoms of bad fit, but nobody thought
of it as being due to bad fit. This directed
marketing messages for years afterwards.

Actions

The customer quotes inspired the company
purpose and vision, becoming central to the
branding.

if it is fit for your purpose in creating the
solution.
Spikes generate strong evidence: you are
working with code that is representative of
the bigger solution.

Capabilities
Product / Technology / Data
You’ll need product capabilities to clearly
communicate how the solution creates the
Value Proposition. This includes answering
any questions from the team and customer
expectations with regard to speed and
quality. Data capabilities are also helpful if
there is any visualization or analytics aspect
to the spike. The most important capability
you’ll need is technology and software,
since the spike is usually working with code
to produce a signal on the next course of
action.

314

The best plans for experimentation don’t
always come through. We’ve learned this
in working with teams to design, run, and
analyze experiments over the years. Part
of learning this process is becoming more
proficient at quickly running experiments.
We have found common pitfalls that you
can identify early on and benefit from our
mistakes.

Analysis Paralysis
Overthinking things
that you should just
test and adapt.

Incomparable
Data/Evidence
Messy data that are
not comparable.

–– You get what you invest.
Teams that don’t put in
enough time to test business ideas won’t get great
results. Too often, teams
underestimate what it takes
to conduct multiple experiments and test ideas well.

–– Good ideas and concepts
are important, but too
many teams overthink and
waste time, rather than getting out of the building to
test and adapt their ideas.

–– Too many teams are sloppy
in defining their exact
hypothesis, experiment, and
metrics. That leads to data
that are not comparable
(e.g., not testing with the
exact same customer segment or in wildly different
contexts).

□□ Carve out dedicated time
every week to test, learn,
and adapt.
□□ Set weekly goals in regard
to what you’d like to learn
about your hypotheses.
□□ Visualize your work so
that it becomes clear
when tasks are stalled
or blocked.

□□ Time box your analysis
work.
□□ Differentiate between
reversible and irreversible
decisions. Act fast on the
former. Take more time for
the latter.
□□ Avoid debates of opinion.
Conduct evidence-driven
debates followed by
decisions.

□□ Use the Test Card.
□□ Make test subject, experiment context, and precise
metrics explicit.
□□ Make sure everybody
involved in running the
experiment is part of the
design.

Confirmation Bias
Only believing evidence
that agrees with your
hypothesis.

Too Few Experiments
Conduct only one experiment for your most
important hypothesis.

Failure to Learn
and Adapt
When you don’t take
time to analyze the
evidence to generate
insights and action.

Outsource Testing
When you outsource
what you should be
doing and learning
yourself.

–– Often teams are happy
with running surveys and
interviews and they fail to
go deeper into how people
act in real life situations.

–– Sometimes teams discard
or underplay evidence that
conflicts with their hypothesis. They prefer the illusion
of being correct in their
prediction.

–– Few teams realize how
many experiments they
should conduct to validate
a hypothesis. They make
decisions on important
hypotheses based on one
experiment with weak
evidence.

–– Some teams get so deep
into testing that they forget
to keep their eyes on the
prize. The goal is not to test
and learn. The goal is to
decide, based on evidence
and insights, to progress
from idea to business.

–– Outsourcing testing is
rarely a wise idea. Testing
is about rapid iterations
between testing, learning,
and adapting an idea. An
agency can’t make those
rapid decisions for you and
you risk wasting time and
energy by outsourcing.

□□ Conduct multiple experimentsfor important
hypotheses.

□□ Set aside time to synthesize your results, generate
insights, and adapt your
idea.

□□ Don’t just believe what
people say.
□□ Run call-to-action
experiments.
□□ Generate evidence that gets
as close as possible to the
real world situation you are
trying to test.

□□ Involve others in the data
synthesis process to bring
in different perspectives.
□□ Create competing hypotheses to challenge your
beliefs.
□□ Conduct multiple experiments for each hypothesis.

□□ Differentiate between weak
and strong evidence.
□□ Increase the strength of
evidence with decreasing
uncertainty.

□□ Always navigate between
detailed testing process
and big picture idea: which
patterns that matter are
you observing?
□□ Create rituals to keep your
eyes on the prize: ask if
you’re making progress
from idea to business.

□□ Shift resources you reserved
for an agency to internal
team members.
□□ Build up a team of professional testers.

Improving
Business
Models

Language

Facilitation

Leaders who are improving existing business
models need to be aware of their language
and tone. Chances are you have evolved
into a leader over time because you are an
expert with knowledge and experience.
As you lead teams through experimenting on a known business model, be mindful
of the fact that overuse of your words can
unintentionally disempower the teams. They
may feel as though their decision-making
authority is taken away, even if you are
merely giving your opinion. They’ll simply
wait for you to assign them experiments,
which is not ideal.

How you interact with teams while improving
business models is also important. As you
grow into a leader at higher levels of the
organization, you’ll realize that facilitation
skills are imperative.
We recommend taking courses on facilitation to level up your leadership game.
There might be many different options to
improve the business and instead of choosing one, use facilitation to select multiple
experiments. Have the evidence shape what
approach works best for your business.

□□ “We, Us, Our”
□□ “How would you achieve this business outcome?”

Accountability
Accountability often has a negative connotation in today’s organizations, but it
doesn’t need to. Teams do not always need
to be “held accountable” to hitting dates
and releasing features. While features are
important, they are outputs, not outcomes.
Remember to focus on business outcomes,
not just the features and dates.
Your teams need the opportunity to give
an account on how they are experimenting
and making progress toward business outcomes. As a leader, it’s your job to create an
environment for these opportunities to occur.

□□ “Can you think of 2 – 3 additional experiments?”

–– “I, Me, Mine”
–– “Deliver this feature by release date.”
–– “This is the only experiment we should run.”

Allow your intuition to guide
you to a conclusion, no matter
how imperfect — this is the
“strong opinion” part. Then —
and this is the “weakly held”
part — prove yourself wrong.
— Paul Saffo

SYNOPSIS

Strong Opinions, Weakly Held
□□ “What is your learning goal?”

Inventing new business models requires
experimentation and openness to the idea
of being wrong. One way to think about this
is from Paul Saffo’s “strong opinions, weakly
held” approach. It means you start out with
a hypothesis, but be open for it to be proven
wrong. If you are merely trying to prove that
you are right, then you become susceptible
to your cognitive biases.
For example, when attending a stakeholder review, teams will be sharing what
they tested and where they want to go. If
you lead with answers and ignore all of the
data that contradict your opinion, it’ll be
a very frustrating meeting for everyone.
It’ll essentially unravel the experimentation
culture you are trying to build.

□□ “What obstacles can I remove to help you
make progress?”
□□ “How else might we approach this problem?”

319

□□ “What learning has surprised you so far?”

–– “I don’t trust the data.”
–– “I still think it’s a good idea and we should
build it anyway.”
–– “You need to talk to 1,000 customers before
it means anything.”
–– “This has to be a $15 million dollar business
by the end of next year.”

Steps
Leaders
Can Take

Create an Enabling Environment:
Processes, Metrics, and Culture

Make Sure Evidence Trumps Opinion:
Change Decision-Making

Leadership’s key role in helping test
business ideas is to create the right environment. Give people enough time and
resources to test ideas iteratively. Leaders
need to abolish business plans and establish appropriate testing processes and
metrics that differ from execution processes
and metrics. They need to give teams the
autonomy to make decisions, move fast, and
then get out of the way.

Leaders are used to deciding based on their
often deep experience and extensive track
record. Yet, in innovation and entrepreneurship, past experience might actually prevent
an individual from seeing and adapting
to the future. Here evidence from testing
trumps opinion. The leader’s role is to push
a team to make a compelling case for an
idea based on evidence, not based on the
leader’s preferences.

Remove Obstacles and Open Doors:
Access to Customers, Brand, IP, and
Other Resources

Ask Questions Rather Than Provide
Answers: Help Teams Grow and Adapt
Their Ideas

Leaders can remove obstacles when teams
that are testing business ideas encounter
internal roadblocks, like lack of access to
internal expertise or specialized resources.
Leaders can open doors to customers when
required. It’s surprising how few corporate
innovation and growth teams have easy
access to customers to test new ideas.

Leaders need to up their questioning skills
to push teams to develop better value
propositions and business models that
can succeed in the real world. They need
to relentlessly inquire about experiments,
evidence, insights, and patterns on which
teams build Value Propositions and business
model ideas.

Create
More
Leaders

Say “I Don’t Know.”

Leaders need to bring their teams along for
the journey, instead of inadvertently leaving
them behind. Think of where you eventually
want team members to be, then look backward. How will they get here? What steps
will they have to take? It’s a small cognitive
trick but it works. Leaders need a sense of
where their teams are today and how to
nudge them down that path. Find opportunities to guide them to take that first step,
whether it be in scheduled one-on-ones,
retrospectives, or in hallway conversations.

These three simple words can strike fear
into the heart of leaders. “I don’t know.” We
often ask leaders when was the last time
they uttered these three words in front of
their employees. The answers range from
“Why, just yesterday!” to “Never!” It’s the
latter answer that is concerning. Imagine
feeling the pressure of leading an organization and always having the answers. There’s
a good chance that you don’t have them.
When building a culture of innovation and
entrepreneurship, acting like you have all
the answers can be disastrous. Teams will
quickly see through the veil once they learn
how to run experiments and generate their
own evidence. Worse yet, you’ll feel like you
have undermined your position of leadership
by being proven wrong. Instead, we strongly
recommend that you practice saying these
three words, “I don’t know,” when you are
in a situation where you don’t know. It
will help your teams begin to understand
that you don’t have all of the answers, nor
should you. Follow it up with “How would you
approach this?” or “What do you think we
should do?” Saying “I don’t know” will help
you model the behavior the leaders you
create will embrace.

Understand Context Before Giving Advice
Leaders need to actively listen and understand the context before giving advice
to team members. Practice letting team
members speak until they are finished. Once
there is a pause in the conversation, ask
clarifying questions to make sure you understand the context before giving advice. Don't
get too excited and interrupt team members
while they are speaking because you’ve
already thought of an answer. You may prematurely provide advice and connected dots
where none exist.

Much of how we’ve structured organizations today
is based on the Industrial Era. Back then, you would
create a factory to assemble a product, such as an
automobile. You’d break the creation of an automobile into tasks, create an assembly line, and have
workers complete the same task over and over. This
works if you know the solution, since you can analyze
your way to efficiently create the solution. Today’s
corporations are, not coincidentally, modeled the
same way. We create projects, break them down into
tasks, and assign them across functions. Organizing
by function can work if you truly know the problem
and the solution — and nothing changes.
We’ve learned over the last few decades of work
that rarely do we know the solution, especially in
software. Things change fast. Really fast. So the idea
that the solution is known and nothing changes is
becoming less and less common in today’s market.
This is why there has been a shift from traditional,
functionally siloed organization models to more agile,
cross-functional team approaches. When testing out
new business ideas, speed and agility are imperative.
cross-functional teams can adapt more quickly than
functionally siloed teams. In many organizations,
small, dedicated, cross-functional teams can outperform large, siloed project teams.

Thinking Like
a Venture Capitalist
Another outdated model we observe in organizations pertains to
funding. Many organizations still adhere to the big bang, annual
funding style of the past. This severely limits the agility of the
organization and incentivizes bad behavior. For example, if your
department doesn’t spend all of its budget, then it is likely your
budget for the upcoming fiscal year will be decreased. Therefore,
budget is spent not on the most impactful activities, but those
that will ensure there will be no money left at the end of the cycle.
Annual funding also limits your at-bats, in that instead of taking one
big home run swing, you’re much better off taking several base hit
level swings. This is where organizations can learn from the Venture
Capital community. Unfortunately, the level of patience and willingness to give teams space is somewhat limited in organizations,
as we illustrate below.

In contrast to the annual budgeting, organizations are adopting a more venture
capitalist-style approach. This helps leaders
invest incrementally in a series of business
ideas and double down on the ones that are
successful. It greatly increases your at-bats
and your chance at finding a unicorn,
instead of placing 1–2 large bets.

Investment Committees
Another important aspect of funding in a venture capitalist-style method is having a small
investment committee that consists of leadership to usher the process along. These leaders
in the organization need to have decision-making authority when it comes to budget,
because they’ll be helping the teams navigate from seed, launch, and growth stages.
These funding decisions typically take place in the Stakeholder Review Ceremony (see
page 80). While we recommend stakeholder reviews to occur every month, the investment
decisions usually take place at 3 – 6 month intervals, depending on your business venture.
Here are some guidelines when it comes to creating your investment committee.

Create a Working Agreement

Foster an Environment

• 3 – 5 members: Keep the committee relatively small in size so that you can make
decisions and run fast.

Once assembled, create a working agreement for the committee before inviting teams
to present their recommendations. As a team,
write down and agree upon rules such as:

This committee is in part responsible for fostering the team environment we introduced
on page 10.

• External member: Consider adding an
external member or entrepreneur in
residence (EIR) who can help bring a fresh
perspective to the portfolio.
• Decision-making authority: Include members who can make decisions with regard
to approval and budget.
• Entrepreneurial: While members do not
necessarily have to have a history of
entrepreneurship, they need to be willing
to challenge the status quo. Too many
conservative members will prematurely
stunt the growth of new innovations.

• Be on time: Members have busy schedules, but they have to prioritize the
stakeholder review ceremonies, otherwise
teams will be left wondering if their initiatives are important.
• Make decisions in the meeting: Teams
should not leave the review wondering if
they can move forward. Decide with the
teams present before adjourning.
• Leave ego at the door: Have an opinion in
the review but be willing to be swayed by
evidence. The teams will be bringing what
experiments they ran and how to move
forward. It is your job to listen, not talk
over them.

Without your help, the teams will not be
able to sustain over time even if they
are cross-functional and exhibit the right
behaviors.
As a committee, have a plan to revisit how
you are helping the team with obstacles
centered on:
• Time.
• Multitasking.
• Funding.
• Support.
• Access.
• Direction.

I particularly want to thank Steve Blank,
one of the seminal modern thinkers on entrepreneurship, and a good friend and mentor.
Without Steve’s Customer Development
process, his founding of the entire Lean
Startup movement, and his personal encouragement, my books would have remained a
modern version of the business plan — great
in concept, not grounded in reality. Steve’s
thinking, experience, and writing on the topic
of “getting out of the building” and testing
ideas with customers, became the foundation of much of my own thinking. Many of
the ideas in this book emerged from long
conversations with Steve, on walks at his
beautiful ranch.
