1 Customer Segments
The Customer Segments Building Block defines
the diΩerent groups of people or organizations an
enterprise aims to reach and serve
Customers comprise the heart of any business model. Without
(profitable) customers, no company can survive for long. In order
to better satisfy customers, a company may group them into
distinct segments with common needs, common behaviors,
or other attributes. A business model may define one or several
large or small Customer Segments. An organization must make
a conscious decision about which segments to serve and which
segments to ignore. Once this decision is made, a business model
can be carefully designed around a strong understanding of
specific customer needs.

bmgen_final.indd 20

Customer groups represent separate segments if:
• Their needs require and justify a distinct oΩer

2 Value Propositions
The Value Propositions Building Block describes
the bundle of products and services that create
value for a specific Customer Segment
The Value Proposition is the reason why customers turn to one
company over another. It solves a customer problem or satisfies
a customer need. Each Value Proposition consists of a selected
bundle of products and/or services that caters to the requirements
of a specific Customer Segment. In this sense, the Value Proposition is an aggregation, or bundle, of benefits that a company
oΩers customers.
Some Value Propositions may be innovative and represent a
new or disruptive oΩer. Others may be similar to existing market
oΩers, but with added features and attributes.

3 Channels
The Channels Building Block describes how a
company communicates with and reaches its
Customer Segments to deliver a Value Proposition
Communication, distribution, and sales Channels comprise a
company's interface with customers. Channels are customer touch
points that play an important role in the customer experience.
Channels serve several functions, including:
• Raising awareness among customers about a company’s
products and services
• Helping customers evaluate a company’s Value Proposition
• Allowing customers to purchase specific products and services
• Delivering a Value Proposition to customers
• Providing post-purchase customer support

4 Customer Relationships
The Customer Relationships Building Block
describes the types of relationships a company
establishes with specific Customer Segments
A company should clarify the type of relationship it wants to
establish with each Customer Segment. Relationships can range
from personal to automated. Customer relationships may be
driven by the following motivations:
• Customer acquisition
• Customer retention
• Boosting sales (upselling)

bmgen_final.indd 28

In the early days, for example, mobile network operator Customer
Relationships were driven by aggressive acquisition strategies
involving free mobile phones. When the market became saturated,
operators switched to focusing on customer retention and increasing average revenue per customer.
The Customer Relationships called for by a company’s business
model deeply inﬂuence the overall customer experience.

5 Revenue Streams
The Revenue Streams Building Block represents
the cash a company generates from each Customer
Segment (costs must be subtracted from revenues to
create earnings)
If customers comprise the heart of a business model, Revenue
Streams are its arteries. A company must ask itself, For what value
is each Customer Segment truly willing to pay? Successfully
answering that question allows the firm to generate one or more
Revenue Streams from each Customer Segment. Each Revenue
Stream may have diΩerent pricing mechanisms, such as fixed list
prices, bargaining, auctioning, market dependent, volume dependent, or yield management.

bmgen_final.indd 30

A business model can involve two diΩerent types of Revenue Streams:
1. Transaction revenues resulting from one-time customer payments
2. Recurring revenues resulting from ongoing payments to either

customer support

6 Key Resources

The Key Resources Building Block describes
the most important assets required to make a
business model work
Every business model requires Key Resources. These resources
allow an enterprise to create and oΩer a Value Proposition, reach
markets, maintain relationships with Customer Segments, and
earn revenues. DiΩerent Key Resources are needed depending on
the type of business model. A microchip manufacturer requires
capital-intensive production facilities, whereas a microchip designer
focuses more on human resources.
Key resources can be physical, financial, intellectual, or human.
Key resources can be owned or leased by the company or acquired
from key partners.

7 Key Activities
The Key Activities Building Block describes
the most important things a company must do
to make its business model work
Every business model calls for a number of Key Activities. These
are the most important actions a company must take to operate
successfully. Like Key Resources, they are required to create and
oΩer a Value Proposition, reach markets, maintain Customer
Relationships, and earn revenues. And like Key Resources, Key

8 Key Partnerships
The Key Partnerships Building Block describes
the network of suppliers and partners that make
the business model work
Companies forge partnerships for many reasons, and partnerships
are becoming a cornerstone of many business models. Companies
create alliances to optimize their business models, reduce risk, or
acquire resources.
We can distinguish between four diΩerent types of partnerships:
1. Strategic alliances between non-competitors
2. Coopetition: strategic partnerships between competitors
3. Joint ventures to develop new businesses
4. Buyer-supplier relationships to assure reliable supplies

9 Cost Structure
The Cost Structure describes all costs incurred to
operate a business model
This building block describes the most important costs incurred
while operating under a particular business model. Creating and delivering value, maintaining Customer Relationships, and generating
revenue all incur costs. Such costs can be calculated relatively easily
after defining Key Resources, Key Activities, and Key Partnerships.
Some business models, though, are more cost-driven than others.
So-called “no frills” airlines, for instance, have built business models
entirely around low Cost Structures.

Success depends on sustaining longterm company viability and growth. Key
to this is a business model innovation

This section describes business models with similar characteristics,
similar arrangements of business model Building Blocks, or similar
behaviors. We call these similarities business model patterns. The
patterns described in the following pages should help you understand
business model dynamics and serve as a source of inspiration for
your own work with business models.
We’ve sketched out five business model patterns built on important
concepts in the business literature. We’ve “translated” these into
the language of the Business Model Canvas to make the concepts
comparable, easy to understand, and applicable. A single business
model can incorporate several of these patterns.
Concepts upon which our patterns are based include Unbundling,
the Long Tail, Multi-Sided Platforms, FREE, and Open Business Models.
New patterns based on other business concepts will certainly emerge
over time.

FREE as a Business Model
patterns

90

Receiving something free of charge has always
been an attractive Value Proposition. Any marketer or
economist will confirm that the demand generated at a price of zero
is many times higher than the demand generated at one cent or any other price
point. In recent years free offers have exploded, particularly over the Internet. The question, of course, is how can you systematically offer something for free and still earn substantial
revenues? Part of the answer is that the cost of producing certain giveaways, such as online data storage
capacity, has fallen dramatically. Yet to make a profit, an organization offering free products or services must
still generate revenues somehow.
There are several patterns that make integrating free products and services into a business model possible. Some of the traditional FREE patterns are well known, such as advertising, which is based on the previously discussed pattern of multi-sided
platforms (see p. 76). Others, such as the so-called freemium model, which provides basic services free of charge and premium
services for a fee, have become popular in step with the increasing digitization of goods and services offered via the Web.
Chris Anderson, whose Long Tail concept we discussed previously (see p. 66), has helped the concept of FREE gain widespread
recognition. Anderson shows that the rise of new free-of-charge offers is closely related to the fundamentally different economics of digital products and services. For example, creating and recording a song costs an artist time and money, but the cost of
digitally replicating and distributing the work over the Internet is close to zero. Hence, an artist can promote and deliver music
to a global audience over the Web, as long as he or she finds other Revenue Streams, such as concerts and merchandising, to cover costs. Bands and artists who have experimented successfully with free music include Radiohead and Trent
Reznor of Nine Inch Nails.
In this section we look at three different patterns that make FREE a viable business model option. Each
has different underlying economics, but all share a common trait: at least one Customer Segment
continuously benefits from the free-of-charge offer. The three patterns are (1) free offer based
on multi-sided platforms (advertising-based), (2) free basic services with optional
premium services (the so-called “freemium” model), (3) and the “bait &
hook” model whereby a free or inexpensive initial offer lures
customers into repeat purchases.

the world’s largest social network. Yet users are
less responsive to Facebook advertising than
to traditional Web ads, according to industry
experts. While advertising is only one of several

Skype disrupted the telecommunications
industry and helped drive voice communication costs close to zero. Telecom operators
initially didn’t understand why Skype would
offer calls for free and didn’t take the company
seriously. What’s more, only a tiny fraction
of the traditional carriers’ customers used
Skype. But over time more and more customers
decided to make their international calls with
Skype, eating into one of the most lucrative
carrier revenue sources. This pattern, typical of
a disruptive business model, severely affected
the traditional voice communication business,
and today Skype is the world’s largest provider
of cross-border voice communication services,
according to telecommunications research
firm Telegeography.

The Value Proposition targets only the most

challenge

Costs are too high.
Several conflicting organizational cultures
are combined in a single entity, resulting in

Targeting less profitable segments with specific
Value Propositions is too costly.

solution
(after)

The business is unbundled into three separate

• Product innovation
• Customer relationships

The new or additional Value Proposition targets
a large number of historically less profitable,
niche Customer Segments—which in aggregate
are profitable.

rationale

IT and management tool improvements allow
separating and coordinating different business
models at lower cost, thus eliminating undesirable trade-offs.

IT and operations management improvements

One Value Proposition targets one
Customer Segment.

A high-value, high-cost Value Proposition
is offered to paying customers only.

R&D Resources and Key Activities are
concentrated in-house:
• Ideas are invented “inside” only
• Results are exploited “inside” only

Enterprise fails to acquire potential new customers who are interested in gaining access to
a company’s existing customer base (e.g. game
developers who want to reach console users)

The high price dissuades customers.

R&D is costly and/or productivity is falling.

A Value Proposition “giving access” to a company’s existing Customer Segment is added
(e.g. a game console manufacturer provides
software developers with access to its users)

Several Value Propositions are offered to
different Customer Segments with different
Revenue Streams, one of them being freeof-charge (or very low cost).

Internal R&D Resources and Activities are
leveraged by utilizing outside partners.
Internal R&D results are transformed into a
Value Proposition and offered to interested
Customer Segments.

An intermediary operating a platform between
two or more Customer Segments adds Revenue
Streams to the initial model.

Non-paying Customer Segments are subsidized
by paying customers in order to attract the
maximum number of users.

Acquiring R&D from external sources can
be less expensive, resulting in faster timeto-market. Unexploited innovations have
the potential to bring in more revenue when
sold outside.

		 Roger Martin, Dean, Rotman School of Management

bmgen_final.indd 124

6/15/10 5:39 PM

This section describes a number of techniques and tools from the world
of design that can help you design better and more innovative business
models. A designer’s business involves relentless inquiry into the best possible way to create the new, discover the unexplored, or achieve the functional. A designer’s job is to extend the boundaries of thought, to generate
new options, and, ultimately, to create value for users. This requires the
ability to imagine “that which does not exist.” We are convinced that the
tools and attitude of the design profession are prerequisites for success in
the business model generation.
Businesspeople unknowingly practice design every day. We design organizations, strategies, business models, processes, and projects. To do this,
we must take into account a complex web of factors, such as competitors,
technology, the legal environment, and more. Increasingly, we must do so in
unfamiliar, uncharted territory. This is precisely what design is about. What
businesspeople lack are design tools that complement their business skills.

The following pages explore six business model design techniques:
Customer Insights, Ideation, Visual Thinking, Prototyping, Storytelling, and
Scenarios. We introduce each technique with a story, then demonstrate
how the technique applies to business model design. Here and there we've
added exercises and suggestions for workshop activities that show you
specifically how the design technique can be applied. Book references are
provided at the end for those interested in exploring each technique in
more depth.

Another challenge lies in knowing which customers to heed and which customers to ignore.
Sometimes tomorrow’s growth segments wait
at the periphery of today’s cash cows. Therefore
business model innovators should avoid focusing
exclusively on existing Customer Segments and
set their sights on new or unreached segments.
A number of business model innovations have
succeeded precisely because they satisfied the
unmet needs of new customers. For example,

The Power of “What If” Questions

IdeatIon

We often have trouble conceiving innovative business
models because we are held back in our thinking by the
status quo. The status quo stifles imagination. One way
to overcome this problem is to challenge conventional

140140 assumptions with “what if” questions. With the right
desIgn

business model ingredients, what we think of as impossible might be just doable. “What if” questions help
us break free of constraints imposed by current models.
They should provoke us and challenge our thinking.
They should disturb us as intriguing, difficult-to-execute
propositions.
Managers of a daily newspaper might ask themselves:
What if we stopped our print edition and went to
entirely digital distribution, through Amazon’s Kindle
e-book reader or through the Web? This would allow the
newspaper to drastically reduce production and logistics
costs, but would require making up lost print advertising
revenues and transitioning readers to digital Channels.
“What if” questions are merely starting points. They
challenge us to discover the business model that could
make their suppositions work. Some “what if” questions
may remain unanswered because they are too provocative. Some may simply need the right business model to
become reality.

Key question: What innovations can we imagine for each business
model building block?
During this phase the team expands the range of possible solutions, aiming to generate
as many ideas as possible. Each of the nine business model building blocks can serve as
a starting point. The goal of this phase is quantity, not quality. Enforcing brainstorming
rules will keep people focused on generating ideas rather than on critiquing too early in
the process (see p. 144).

Enforce rules
Clarify the brainstorming rules upfront and enforce them. The most
important rules are "defer judgment," "one conversation at a time,"
"go for quantity," "be visual," and "encourage wild ideas." Facilitators
should enforce the rules.
Think visually
Write ideas down or sketch them out on a surface everyone can see. A
good way to collect ideas is to jot them down on Post-it™ notes and stick
these to a wall. This allows you to move ideas around and regroup them.
Prepare
Prepare for brainstorming with some sort of immersion experience
related to the problem at hand. This could be a field trip, discussions with
customers, or any other means of immersing the team in issues related
to your problem statement.

Visualizing with Post-it™ notes

desIgn

150150

A set of Post-it™ notes is an indispensable tool that everyone reflecting on business
models should keep handy. Post-it™ notes function like idea containers that can be added,
removed, and easily shifted between business model building blocks. This is important
because during business model discussions, people frequently do not immediately agree
on which elements should appear in a Business Model Canvas or where they should be
placed. During exploratory discussions, some elements might be removed and replaced
multiple times to explore new ideas.
Here are three simple guidelines: (1) use thick marking pens, (2) write only one element
per Post-it™ note, and (3) write only a few words per note to capture the essential point.
Using thick markers is more than a detail: it prevents you from putting too much information on a single Post-it™, and makes for easier reading and overview.
Keep in mind, too, that the discussion leading to the final business model picture created
by all the Post-it™ notes is just as important as the outcome. Discussion around which
notes to place on or remove from the Canvas and debate over how one element influences
others give participants a deep understanding of the business model and its dynamics.
Consequently, a Post-it™ note becomes more than just a piece of sticky paper representing a business model building block; it becomes a vector for strategic discussion.

Telling a Visual Story

A powerful way to explain a business model is to tell a story one image at a time.
Presenting a full description within the Business Model Canvas can overwhelm an
audience. It’s better to introduce the model piece by piece. You could do this by drawing
one piece after another, or by using PowerPoint. An appealing alternative is to pre-draw
all the elements of a business model on Post-it™ notes, then put them up one after
another as you explain the model. It allows the audience to follow the build-up of the
model, and the visuals complement your explanation.

dreds of models with different materials and of varying sizes, simply to explore new directions. Boland explains that the goal of this
prototyping activity was far more than the mere testing or proving
of ideas. It was a methodology for exploring different possibilities
until a truly good one emerged. He points out that prototyping, as
practiced by the Gehry group, is a central part of an inquiry process that helps participants gain a better sense of what is missing
in the initial understanding of a situation. This leads to completely
new possibilities, among which the right one can be identified.
For Professor Boland, the experience with Gehry & Associates
was transformative. He now understands how design techniques,
including prototyping, contribute to finding better solutions for
the entire spectrum of business problems. Together with fellow
professor Fred Collopy and other colleagues, Boland is now spearheading the concept of Manage by Designing: the integration of
design thinking, skills, and experiences into Weatherhead’s MBA
curriculum. Here, students use tools of design to sketch alternatives, follow through on problem situations, transcend traditional
boundaries, and prototype ideas.

in the world of business. Let’s examine how storytelling can serve
as a powerful tool to make new business models more tangible.
By their very nature, new or innovative business models can be
difficult to describe and understand. They challenge the status
quo by arranging things in unfamiliar ways. They force listeners
to open their minds to new possibilities. Resistance is one likely
reaction to an unfamiliar model. Therefore, describing new business models in a way that overcomes resistance is crucial.

Here we discuss two types of scenarios. The first describes different customer settings: how products or services are used, what
kinds of customers use them, or customer concerns, desires, and
objectives. Such scenarios build on customer insights (p. 126),
but go a step further by incorporating knowledge about customers into a set of distinct, concrete images. By describing a specific
situation, a customer scenario makes customer insights tangible.
A second type of scenario describes future environments
in which a business model might compete. The goal here is
not to predict the future, but rather to imagine possible
futures in concrete detail. This exercise helps innovators reflect on the most appropriate business

What
stands
in your
way?

In my work with non-profit organizations, the biggest obstacles to business
model innovation are 1. inability
to understand the existing business
model, 2. lack of a language to talk
about business model innovation,
and 3. counterproductive constraints
on imagining the design of new
business models.

I have found that the management
and key employees in many SME
companies lack a common framework
and language for discussing business
model innovation. They do not have the
theoretical background, but they are
essential to the process because they
are the ones who know the business.

The management of an SME (wood
manufacturing industry-WMI) did not
begin changing its business model
until the bank no longer wanted to give
them credit. The biggest obstacle to
business model innovation (in the WMI
case and likely every case) is the people
who resist any changes until problems
appear and need corrective actions.

might be outdated or even obsolete tomorrow. We all have to improve
our understanding of a model’s environment and how it might evolve.
Of course we can’t be certain about the future, because of the complexities,
uncertainties, and potential disruptions inherent in the evolving business
environment. We can, however, develop a number of hypotheses about the
future to serve as guidelines for designing tomorrow’s business models.
Assumptions about how market forces, industry forces, key trends, and
macroeconomic forces unfold give us the “design space” to develop potential
business model options or prototypes (see p. 160) for the future. The role
of business model scenarios (see p. 186) in forecasting should also be evident by now. Painting pictures of the future makes it much easier to generate
potential business models. Depending on your own criteria (e.g. acceptable
level of risk, growth potential sought, etc.) you may then select one option
over another.

evaluating business models

Like seeing the doctor for an annual exam, regularly assessing
a business model is an important management activity that allows an
organization to evaluate the health of its market position and adapt accordingly. This checkup may become the basis for incremental business model
improvements, or it might trigger a serious intervention in the form of a
business model innovation initiative. As the automobile, newspaper, and
music industries have shown, failing to conduct regular checkups may

212

prevent early detection of business model problems, and may even lead
to a company’s demise.
In the previous chapter on the business models environment (see p. 200),
we evaluated the influence of external forces. In this chapter, we adopt the
point of view of an existing business model and analyze external forces from
the inside out.
The following pages outline two types of assessment. First, we provide a
big picture assessment of Amazon.com’s online retailing model circa 2005
and describe how the company has built strategically on that model since.
Second, we provide a set of checklists for assessing your business model’s
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) and to help
you evaluate each Building Block. Keep in mind that assessing a business
model from a big picture perspective and assessing it from a Building Block
perspective are complementary activities. A weakness in one Building
Block, for example, may have consequences for one or several other
Building Blocks—or for the entire model. Business model assessment,
therefore, alternates between individual elements and overall integrity.

managers. When combined with the Business Model Canvas, though, SWOT
enables a focused assessment and evaluation of an organization’s business
model and its Building Blocks.
SWOT asks four big, simple questions. The first two—what are your
organization’s strength and weaknesses?—assess your organization internally. The second two—what opportunities does your organization have
and what potential threats does it face?—assess your organization’s position within its environment. Of these four questions, two look at helpful areas
(strengths and opportunities) and two address harmful areas. It is useful to
ask these four questions with respect to both the overall business model and
each of its nine Building Blocks. This type of SWOT analysis provides a good
basis for further discussions, decision-making, and ultimately innovation
around business models.

using swot assessment analysis results to
design new business model options

A structured SWOT assessment of your business model yields two results.
It provides a snapshot of where you are now (strengths and weaknesses)
and it suggests some future trajectories (opportunities and threats). This is
valuable input that can help you design new business model options toward
which your enterprise can evolve. SWOT analysis is thus a significant part
of the process of designing both business model prototypes (see p. 160) and,
with luck, a new business model that you will eventually implement.

but once you have, the decision about which alternative to select

Finally, the last phase, Manage, is about continuously managing your
business model(s). In today’s climate, it’s best to assume that most

248 business models, even successful ones, will have a short lifespan.
Considering the substantial investment an enterprise makes in
producing a business model, it makes sense to extend its life through
continuous management and evolution until it needs complete
rethinking. Management of the model’s evolution will determine
which components are still relevant and which are obsolete.

book sections

For each process phase we outline the objective, the focus, and
which content in Business Model Generation supports that phase.
Then we outline the five phases in more detail, and explain how the
circumstances and focus can change when you are working with an
existing business model in an established organization.

Once you’ve arrived at a final business model design, you will start

We hope we’ve shown you how visionaries, game changers, and
challengers can tackle the vital issue of business models. We hope
we’ve provided you with the language, the tools and techniques, and
the dynamic approach needed to design innovative and competitive
new models. But much remains to be said. So here we touch on five
topics, each of which might well merit its own book.
The first examines business models beyond profit: how the Canvas can
drive business model innovation in the public and non-profit sectors.
The second suggests how computer-aided business model design might
leverage the paper-based approach and allow for complex manipulation
of business model elements. The third discusses the relationship between
business models and business plans. The fourth addresses issues that
arise when implementing business models in either new or existing
organizations. The final topic examines how to better achieve business
model and IT alignment.

concepts describe the enterprise from three perspectives: the business perspective, the applications perspective, and the technology
perspective. We recommend using the Canvas to guide the business
perspective, then align the business with the applications and technology perspectives.
In the application perspective, you describe the portfolio of
applications that leverage aspects of your business model (e.g.
recommendation systems, supply chain management applications,
etc.) and you describe all the business model’s information requirements (e.g. customer profiles, warehousing, etc.). In the technology
perspective you describe the technology infrastructure that drives
your business model (e.g. server farms, data storage systems, etc.).

process

The core team, consisting of Alexander, Yves, and Patrick start the project
with a number of meetings to sketch out the business model of the book.
The Hub is launched to co-create the book with business model innovation
practitioners throughout the world. Creative Director Alan Smith of The
Movement hears about the project and puts his company behind it. Finally,
Hub member Tim Clark joins the core team after recognizing the need for an
editor. The group is completed by JAM, a company that uses visual thinking
to solve business problems. An engagement cycle is started to pump fresh
“chunks” of content out to the Hub community for feedback and contributions. The writing of the book becomes completely transparent. Content,
design, illustrations, and structure are constantly shared and thoroughly commented upon by Hub members worldwide. The core team responds to every
comment and integrates the feedback back into the book and design. A “soft
launch” of the book is organized in Amsterdam, Netherlands, so members of
the Hub can meet in person and share their experiences with business model
innovation. Sketching out participant business models with JAM becomes the
core exercise of the day. Two hundred special limited edition prototypes of the
(unfinished) book go to print and a video of the writing process is produced
by Fisheye Media. After several more iterations the first print run is produced.

Alex osterwalder, Author
Dr. Osterwalder is an author, speaker, and adviser on the topic of business model
innovation. his practical approach to designing innovative business models, developed together with Dr. Yves Pigneur, is practiced in multiple industries throughout the
world by companies including 3M, Ericsson, Capgemini, Deloitte, Telenor, and many
others. Previously he helped build and sell a strategic consulting firm, participated in
the development of a Thailand-based global nonprofit organization combating hIV/
AIDS and malaria, and did research at the university of Lausanne, Switzerland.

Yves Pigneur, co-Author

innovation, and e-business.

Alan Smith, creative Director
Alan is a big scale thinker who loves the details just as much. he's a co-founder at the
aptly named change agency: The Movement. There he works with inspired clients
to blend community knowledge, business logic, and design thinking. The resulting
